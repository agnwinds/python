# This is the travis yml file which controls the test builds 
# for Python, the radiative transfer code hosted at https://github.com/agnwinds/python
#
# Procedure:
#       - travis automatically clones the main dev branch of the repository
#       - we clone the rest of the directory structure into a folder called structure
#       - note this is different from normal directory layout, but facilitates the build
#       - Cfitsio and gsl are built
#       - we then cd into the main build directory and do make test_tr.
