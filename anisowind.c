/* 
randwind (xyz, lmn, north) is a routine to calculate a new direction
for the photon for specific presciptions regarding the anisotropy
of scattering.  To use a different prescription the only thing that
should have to be modified is vrandwind.

Here 

 xyz is the position of the photon in cartesion coordinates
 north is the the direction of maxium velocity gradient in 
	cylindrical coordinates

and 
 lmn is the new direction of the photon in cartesian coordinates 
	which is returned is returned.

02feb	ksl	Modified jumps in randwind so evenly spaced.
02feb	ksl	Mad major modifications to the way in which
		the direction was projected back to the 
		cartesian frame, and also to the generation
		of the photon direction in the azimuthal
		direction.  The routine was seriously 
		screwed up.
02may	ksl	Made modifications to generalize anisowind
		and to incorporate changes associated
		with creating a new (constant source function)
		based scattering function.  The routines are
		now much more integrated in the sense that
		only one routine vrandwind needs to be
		changed to incorporate a new scattering
		model (as long as the model is axisymmetric)
		about some direction..presumable the direction
		of tau_min.  N.B. There are some dependences
		on the order in which the routines are called,
		i.e. you must call randwind before vrandwind,
		since randwind initializes some variables that
		one needs in vrandwind.  
02may	ksl	Changed calls to avoid having to pass tau_min
		to the routine.  Hopefully this will help
		eliminate questions of what has been calculated
		when, or at least isolate it to the routines
		in this file.
02may	ksl	Added a check to prevent tau from going too low
		when calculating pdf_rand.  ?? It might be more
		computationally efficient to switch to isotropic
		in this case ??

Synopsis:   
  randwind_thermal_trapping is the routine which chooses
  a new anisotropic direction in geo.scatter_mode = 2.
  
Arguments:   

  
Returns:
  0 for success. Also modifies the photon ptr p
  to reflect new direction (p->lmn), and nnscat, which
  should be copied to the phoiton structure after calling
  this routine.
  
Description:  
  This routine uses a rejection method to choose a direction
  so that the probability distribution of directions generated 
  reflects the probability of escape along each direction in accordance
  with the sobolev optical depth. 

Notes:
  
History:
  1406  Moved code here from photo_gen_matom and scatter to avoid 
        duplication
