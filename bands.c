/***********************************************************

Synopsis:

Python uses a form of stratified sampling in an attempt to assure
that there are photon bundles at (high, generally) frequencies

This is the routine that initializes the bands.    There are
a number of possiblilities for setting up the bands


   
Arguments:		
     double t;			A temperature which can be used to set absolute limits on the bands
     double f1, f2;		frequency limits that can overide any other limits
     int imode;			A switch used for determining how the bands are to be populated
     struct xbands *band;	A poointer to the structure that holds the band information

     The currently allow modes are 

	imode	0	Use temperature to define a single band
		1	Use f1 and f2 to define a single band
		2	Use t,f1 and f2, and hardwired bands
			to define multiple bands which have been
			tuned to be relevent to CVs and other
			systems where a hot disk (T_eff of about
			100,000 K is assumed
		3	Bands tuned for yso
		4	Query the user to specify an arbitrary
			set of bands
Returns:

	The outputs are passed to other routines through the pointer
	to xbands.  The routine itself simply returns 0 on success
 
 
Description:	

		
Notes:

	10nov - ksl - Some of the choices have checks to see whether the bands
	that are being set up lie within f1 and f2.  Others do
	not.  This seems like an error.


History:
	01dec	ksl	python40
	02jul	ksl	Adapted from an similar routine used to set
			up bands in photon_gen.  This may eventually
			replace that routine
	0810	ksl	67 - Cleaned up slightly during relook
			at balance
	0812	ksl	67c - Changed names to bands_init to make
			it clear other routines created for diagnostic
			purposes had to be updated, as modified 
			to handle yso and cv type models in same
			code
	1112	ksl	71 - Moved material that was in python having
			to do with banding to this point.  Note
			This breaks the calls that exist in balance
	1208    nsh     73 - Several new bands
