Synopsis:
	get_ion_density finds the density of a specific ion designated by nion, at a position held in
the photon pointer p

Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	
Notes:

	Densities (rho) are defined at the centers of cells. rho is defined in wind2d.c
	an etends from 0 to NDIM-1 (inclusive), and 0 to MDIM-1 (inclusive) . However, 
	in wind_updates2d.c, the ionization fractions are only calculated from 0 to NDIM-2, 
        and 0 to MDIM-2 inclusive.


History:
 	01mar	ksl	Added this possibility
	04nov	ksl	53b: Made modifications to allow for 
			different coordinate systems
	05apr	ksl	55d: Adapted to new version of coord_fraction
			in continuing effort to enable more 
			coordinate systems.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Modified to use plasma structure
