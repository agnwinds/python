  Synopsis:

The routines in this file all have to do with dielectronic recombination.


  Description:

The first routine is compute_dr_coeffs
It takes as its input a temperature, and it populates the fd_coeff array.
This is an initial test, and it will be called every time a cell needs a set
of DR coefficients. It could well be quicker in the future to generate one,
temperature split array, and then sample it. Lets see...
