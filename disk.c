   The routine determines the speed by interpolating on stored

   the position, to determine the direction of motion at this point
   in the disk
  
   Finally it rescales this to get the actual velocity.
  
   is travelling in the
   disk by interpolating on the velocities that are contained

	The routine projects the input variable x on to the xy plane
	before it calculates velocities.
