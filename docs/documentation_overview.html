    <h1>Documentation Overview</h1>
    <p> Note:&nbsp; Documentation is an ongoing effort, and is not
      always up to date. If you notice a problem, please open an<a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://github.com/agnwinds/python/issues"> issue on
        github</a> describing the issue, or, if you are able fix the
      problem.<br>
    </p>
    <p> At present the main resources are as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A draft version of a <a href="cookbook.pdf">cookbook</a>
        which describes how to install&nbsp; and update Python and run a
        first model</li>
      <li> A <a href="sphinx/html/index.html">Sphinx</a> repository,
        which provides the main documentation for Python</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A fairly up-to-date version of this documentation may be
          found on Readthedocs <a
            href="https://agnwinds.readthedocs.io/en/readthedocs/">here</a></li>
        <li>However, if one wishes to have the latest/local version, or
          the version for a particular branch, one needs to generate the
          html files locally from the source (.rst) files which are
          tracked in git.</li>
        <li>To generate the Sphinx documentation one needs <a
            href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">sphinx</a></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The command to generate the repository is currently:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>cd docs/sphinx/; make html</li>
        </ul>
        <li>More instructions on how to do the updates are locally <a
            href="file:///Users/long/Python/docs/sphinx/html/meta.html">here<br>
          </a></li>
        <ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li> A <a href="pydocs/doc_py_progs.html">pydocs repository</a>
        which provides information about the python scripts contained in
        $PYTHON/py_progs</li>
      <ul>
        <li>These files are also tracked by git.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>The documentation should be updated if new python routines
          are added to py_progs, or if modifications to the _doc_
          strings are made in existing programs</li>
        <li>To regenerate them, use the routine write_docs.py which is
          in py_progs.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>Issue the following command from the docs/pydocs
          directory.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>../../py_progs/write_docs.py ../../py_progs</li>
        </ul>
        <li>No special software is required, except that the package
          MarkupPy may need to be installed via several methods
          including<br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>pip install MarkupPy<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>A <a href="doxygen/html/index.html">Doxygen repository, </a>which



        provides information about the source code.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Like the other documentation, the Doxygen information is not
          part of the repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore if you want
          this, one will have to run software to generate the
          documentation.<br>
        </li>
        <li>To do this, one must go to the docs/doxygen directory and
          run</li>
        <ul>
          <li>doxygen python_docs.config</li>
          <li>(Note to developers:&nbsp; If a new routine, like
            windsave2table, that has it's own main routine is added to
            the repository, please make sure to use the EXCLUDE option
            in python_docs.config to assure that it is not included in
            the doxygen outputs.&nbsp; doxygen does not handle this
            well, and python should be the routine we want the
            documentation to apply to.)<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Of course the assumes that you have doxygen <br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The Doxygen home page is <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/">here</a>.&nbsp;





            <br>
          </li>
          <li>To get the graphs that show which routines call which
            other routines, you also need to have the dot tool from <a
              href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> installed as
            well.&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      Comments:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The S/W discussed above is readily available on various
        package distributions, e.g <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>
        or <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> or <a
          href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> for Macs or one
        can use conda.&nbsp; Presumably, various linux package managers
        contain as well. &nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Homebrew command for Sphinx is simply "brew install
          Sphinx"<br>
        </li>
        <li>The Homebrew command for doxygen is simply "brew install
          doxygen"</li>
        <li>The Homebrew command for GraphViz is similarly "brew install
          GraphViz" <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Alternatively, one can go to&nbsp; the home pages and download
        and install using the instruction provided.<br>
      </li>
