These directories contain notes and in some cases
(ipynb) scripts that are explain some details about Python

PLEASE REMOVE THE SCRIPTS FROM THE REPOSITORY BEFORE RUNNING
THEM AS RUUNING THEM WILL CAUSE THEM TO CHANGE EVEN IF
NOTHING IS MODIFIED.

OF COURSE IF ONE DOES NEED TO UPDATE A SCRIPT, THEN BY 
ALL MEANS RUN IT AND COMMIT IT.
