    "## The photoionization rate estimator for simple atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple atoms, we use different photoionization rate estimators. Actually, strictly speaking, we do have a mode in which (I think) we use effectively the same estimators as for macro atoms -- this is \"matrix_est\" mode. However, usually we use \"matrix_pow\" mode, in which we don't calculate estimators directly from individual photon bundles, but instead use the photon bundles to update a banded model spectrum in each cell (i.e. we break the frequency range up into distinct bands and assume that the SED in each band can be described by a simple model, such as a power law).\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimators we use to calculate the spectral models are updated in \"update_banded_estimators\" within \"radiation.c\". \n",
    "\n",
    "It helps here to remind ourselves of the relationship between the mean intensity and the properties of cells and photon bundles (e.g. Eq 23 in LK0 or Eq 97 in NS19). I'll write this down in observer frame terms for now:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J_{obs,phot} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi V_{obs}} \\sum_i^{\\Delta V_{obs}\\Delta t_{obs}} w_{obs,i} \\, \\, \\delta s_{obs,i} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here I've used the subscript \"phot\" to emphasise that this is a \"photon-based\" estimator for $J$. For the banded-model approach, $J$ is worked out separately for each band, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "So $J_{obs,phot}$ is updated on a photon-by-photon basis in update_banded_estimators. The same routine also works out things like the average frequency in each band. (This isn't irrelevant for frame transformation issues, because obviously here, too, one needs to think about which frame we're in.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going into unnecessary details, the point of the banded-model approach is to improve the statistics by assuming a particular shape for the SED in a given cell. If the model *shape* has free parameters, we can estimate these from various statistics of the photon population (e.g. the variance). But, with the shape fixed, the *normalization* in each band is essentially determined by insisting that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J_{obs,phot} = J_{obs,mod},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J_{obs,mod}$ is the *model* prediction for the mean intensity in this cell and this band."

    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The photo-ionization rate estimator used for ionization state calculations is actually worked out in the routine \"calc_pi_rate\". This, in turn, uses qromb to integrate the function defined in (for example, for the power-law case) \"tb_logpow\". The integration then spits out\n",

    "\n",
    "As shown, this quantity is $\\gamma_{pi}$ as defined in NS19, Eq 101. It's the  photo-ionization rate per second per relevant atom (i.e. when multiplied by the number density of relevant atoms, it's the photo-ionization rate per unit time per unit volume per photo-ionization target atom). This means footnote 35 in NS19 is wrong -- the quantity defined there isn't $\\gamma_{pi}$, but $n_{a} \\gamma_{pi}$. Note also that they actually simply use $\\gamma$ for this quantity, but I'm not here because we're already using $\\gamma$ for the Lorentz factor.\n",

    "Since our computational grid is defined in the observer frame, we don't really know what $\\Delta V_{cmf}$ is. All we really know is what $\\Delta V_{obs}$ is. We do know that $\\Delta V_{cmf} \\Delta t_{cmf} = \\Delta V_{obs} \\Delta t_{obs}$, but Stuart's worry, I believe, was that the we can't be sure we are talking about the *same* space-time volume element in both frames, really, and therefore the photon bundles we are talking about are also not the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my \"derivation\" above, I've argued explicitly that we can simply *define* our comoving space-time volume element to be that which contains the photon bundles we find in the observer-frame space-time volume element. If this is correct, that worry disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it correct though? I can't see any reason why it would not be correct, except that our space-time volume elements aren't really infinitesimal. So the equality between the elements, and that photon bundles they contain, may not be exact. However, at that level, I don't think this issue is any different than the issue of selecting a suitable coordinate system (i.e. spherical polar vs Cartesian) or computational grid (i.e. 50x50 vs 100x100) for a calculation. When we do that, we will end up with (hopefully) slightly different values for all estimators at a given point in space, simply because our cells are now different. So photons that in one system/grid contribute to one cell will contribute to a different cell in a different system/grid. But **so long as the cells are small** and **so long as we use the correct (space)time volume for them**, these differences should not be significant, and they should vanish as our cells get smaller and smaller. For pathologically shaped cells (in any one system/grid), that conversion may be slower than we'd like. But it should still happen. \n",
