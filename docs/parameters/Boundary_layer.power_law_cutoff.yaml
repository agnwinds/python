name: Boundary_layer.power_law_cutoff
description: |
  This is a low frequency cutoff for an AGN-style power law spectrum
  of a form $L_\nu=K\nu^\alpha$, as applied to the boundary layer of a star.
  It prevents the power-law being applied to low frequencies and giving an odd SED.
  See :ref:`Radiation_types` and :ref:`Boundary_layer.power_law_cutoff`.
