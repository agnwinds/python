name: Boundary_layer.rad_type_in_final_spectrum
description: |
  Determines the luminosity and SED of the boundary layer.
  The code can cause a source to radiate differently in the ionisation and spectral cycles.
  This variable allows a boundary layer source to radiate differently from :ref:`Boundary_layer.rad_type_to_make_wind`
  during the cycles used to calculate the output spectra. This can be
type: Enumerator
values:
  bb: |
    Black-body radiation. The boundary layer radiates as a black-body source with surface luminosity set by its
    effective temperature (:ref:`Boundary_layer.temp`) and resulting in a total luminosity
    proportional to its surface area.
  models: |
    Radiate according to a model. Python can support tabulated models that output with a binned luminosity distribution
    depending on system properties like temperature and gravity. See :ref:`Input_spectra.model_file`. The total
    luminosity will be set by :ref:`Boundary_layer.luminosity`.
  uniform: |
    Available for :ref:`System_type` of ``star`` or ``cv``.
    Photons are generated with a random, uniformly-distributed wavelength between
    :ref:`Spectrum.wavemin` and :ref:`Spectrum.wavemax`. Can in some cases substitute for a Kurcuz spectrum.
    This mode is only available when generating final spectra.
