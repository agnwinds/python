name: Boundary_layer.rad_type_to_make_wind
description: |
  Determines the luminosity and SED of the boundary layer.
  The code can cause a source to radiate differently in the ionisation and spectral cycles.
  This variable allows a boundary layer source to radiate differently from :ref:`Boundary_layer.rad_type_in_final_spectrum`
  during the cycles used to calculate the wind ionisation state and temperature.
type: Enumerator
values:
  bb: |
    Black-body radiation. The boundary layer radiates as a black-body source with surface luminosity set by its
    effective temperature (:ref:`Boundary_layer.temp`) and resulting in a total luminosity
    proportional to its surface area.
  models: |
    Radiate according to a model. Python can support tabulated models that output with a binned luminosity distribution
    depending on system properties like temperature and gravity. See :ref:`Input_spectra.model_file`. The total
    luminosity will be set by :ref:`Boundary_layer.luminosity`.
  power:
    Radiate following a power-law model as $L_\nu=K\nu^\alpha$.
    The total luminosity will be set by :ref:`Boundary_layer.luminosity`.
parent:
  Boundary_layer.radiation: true
