name: Reverb.filter_lines
description: |
  Whether or not to filter any lines out of the output file. This is used to keep output
  file sizes down, and avoid them overwhelming the user.
type: Int
values:
  0: |
    **No filtering**

    Include *all* photons that contribute to the spectra in the output
    file. Not recommended as it leads to gargantuan file sizes.
  -1: |
    **Filter continuum**

    Include all photons whose last interaction was scatter
    or emission in a line. Recommended setting for exploratory runs where you'd
    like to identify which lines are the easiest to process.
  N: |
    **Filter lines**

    Include N :ref:`reverb.filter_line` entries, each specifying one
    line to keep in the output file. If :ref:`reverb.matom_lines` is >0, all macro-atom
    lines of interest are automatically included in the filter list.
