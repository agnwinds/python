Radiative transfer and ionisation code
--------------------------------------

Python is a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code designed to simulate the spectrum of biconical (or spherical)
winds in disk systems.  It was origianally written by
`Long and Knigge (2002) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...579..725L/abstract>`_ and
was intended for simulating the spectra of winds in cataclysmic variables. Since then, it has
also been used to simulate the spectra of systems ranging from young stellar objects to AGN.

The name Python is today unfortunate, and changing the name is an ongoing debate within the development team.
The program is written in C and can be compiled on systems runining various flavors of linux, including OSX on Macs.


The code is is available on `github <https://github.com/agnwinds/python>`_  Issues regarding the code and suggestions for improvement the code regarding the should be reported there.  We actively
encourage other to make use of the code for their own science.  If anyone has questions about
whether the code might be useful for a project, we encourage you to contact one of the authors of
the code.
