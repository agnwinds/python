Spectrum.orbit_phase
====================
For binary systems, the orbital phase at which the spectrum
is to be extracted (so the effects of an eclipse can be taken
into account in creating the spectrum). Phase 0 corresponds to
inferior conjunciton, that is with the secondary in front (or
depending on inclination angle, partially in front of) the
primary
