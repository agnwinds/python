Spectrum.select_specific_no_of_scatters_in_spectra
==================================================
Advanced command which allows one to place additional
constraints on the detailed spectra that are extracted.

If yes, then one will be asked to supply details for
each extraction angle.  

The command is useful for diagnositic purposes when 
one would like to separate contributions to the 
spectra from, for example, unscattered, singly scatterred,
and multiply scattered photons.

Type
  Boolean (yes/no)
