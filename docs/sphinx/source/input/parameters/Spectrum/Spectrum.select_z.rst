Spectrum.select_z
=================
Advanced command which defines a spherical  region of
space from which photons are to be extracted in constructing a detailed
spectrum.  The region is defined by a cylindrical distance, and z height
and an aximuth, and a radius r.  This parameter defines the z coordiante
of the region.

Type
  Double

Unit
  cm

Values
  Within the z range of the model
