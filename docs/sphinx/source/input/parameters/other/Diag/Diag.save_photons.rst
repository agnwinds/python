Diag.save_photons
=================
Saves output to ``<file_name>.ext.txt``. This is a diagnostic that allows one to print out information about a photon at any time.
The ``modes.save_photons`` option is entirely commented out of the code and seems inactive in it's current state (2024-05-29).
Save_photons uses the ``save_photons`` function.

The ``save_photons`` columns in the output are assigned in order as follows:

.. code:: 

  geo.pcycle, 
  p->np, 
  p->freq_orig,
  p->freq, 
  p->w_orig,
  p->w,
  p->x[0],
  p->x[1],
  p->x[2],
  p->lmn[0],
  p->lmn[1],
  p->lmn[2],
  p->ds,
  p->tau,
  p->grid,
  p->istat,
  p->origin,
  p->nscat,
  p->nres,
  p->frame,
