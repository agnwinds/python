Diag.use_jumps_for_emissivities_in_detailed_spectra
===================================================

Advanced command, allows one to go back to using the MonteCarlo jumps method, 
rather than the much faster matrix scheme for 
computing macro-atom emissivities in the spectral cycles (see :ref:`Macro-atom Emissivity Calculation`).

Type
  Boolean (yes/no)
