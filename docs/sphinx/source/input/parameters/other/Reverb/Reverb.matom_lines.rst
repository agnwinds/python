Reverb.matom_lines
==================
Number of macro-atom lines to track paths for individually. This many
reverb.matom_line entries are required, and the line associated with each has
the path of photons deexciting into it recorded in its own array. Note: This
doesn't give rise to any noticable differences to the pure wind mode in most
simulations.

Type
  Integer

Values
