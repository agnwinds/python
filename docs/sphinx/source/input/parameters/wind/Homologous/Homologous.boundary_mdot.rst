Homologous.boundary_mdot
========================
The mass loss rate at the base of the wind in a homlogous flow model, a flow
in which the velocity is proporional to the radius.  In general, :math:`\dot{m}` will
decline with radius, depending on the exponent of the power law that describes
the trend in density.
