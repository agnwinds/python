KWD.d
=====
The ratio :math:`d/d_{min}` is used to describe the degree of geometric collimation of
the disk wind in the KWD model. However, only d (the distance to the focal point in
central object radii) is set by the user as this provides a more natural parameter.

For high values of d, the wind is highly collimated, parallel to the rotational axis. 
For intermediate values of d (:math:`d\approx d_{min}`), the wind is more spherically symmetric.
For low values of d, the wind is 'sheet-like' equatorially.
