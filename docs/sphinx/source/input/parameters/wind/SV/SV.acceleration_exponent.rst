SV.acceleration_exponent
========================
Power-law acceleration exponent (i.e. alpha) of a line driven wind in a Shlosman & Vitello (SV) CV disk wind model.
Sets the length scale over which the accleration to v_inf is accomplished.
This value is a constant; when equal to 1 the results resemble those of a linear velocity law.
Typically for an SV type wind this power law exponent is 1.5.
See equation (2) Shlosman & Vitello 1993, ApJ 409, 372.
