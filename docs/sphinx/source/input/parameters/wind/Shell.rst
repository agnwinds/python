Shell
=====


All parameters that define the shell wind model. This model is similar to :ref:`the stellar wind model` but used primarily for diagnostic purposes with hardwired parameters. The model is a single spherical shell of material surrounding the central object, preventing the inner surface of the wind touching the central object.
