Wind.number_of_components
=========================
While most simple description of a wind consist of a single region of space, the user can calculate
radiative transfer through more complicated structures, where one region of space is described with one
prescription and another region of space with a second prescription. For example, one might want to place
a disk atmosphere between the disk and a wind.  This parameter describes the number of components (aka domains)
of the wind.
