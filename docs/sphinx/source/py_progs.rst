Python Scripts
##############

There are several `Python` (the scripting language) scripts written to prepare input for
and analyse the output of *python* (the C code).

These are not yet documented in a way Sphinx can read for inclusion into this documentation.
Currently, to generate the documentation, you must navigate to :code:`docs/pydocs`
and run :code:`write_docs.py`.

The resulting output file can be found `here <../../pydocs/doc_index.html>`_.
