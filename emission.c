Synopsis:  total_emission (one, f1, f2) Calculate the total emission of a single cell 

Arguments:		


Returns:
 
Description:	
	

Notes:
	Total emission gives the total enery loss due to photons.  It does
	not include other coooling sources, e. g. adiabatic expansion.

	It returns the total luminosity, but also stores the luminosity due
	to various types of emssion, e.g ff, fb, lines, compton into the
	Plasms cells

	Comment: The call to this routine was changed when PlasmaPtrs
	were introduced, but it appears that the various routines 
	that were called were not changed.

History:
	97	ksl	Coded
	98oct	ksl     Removed temperature limits within total_emission in
			and attempt to concentrate the frequency limits elsewhere.
	01nov	ksl	Removed superflous code
	01nov	ksl	Changed call so t_e passed through wind structure.  Other
			routines should be changed ALSO, BUT NOT NOW
	04Mar   SS      Modified to divert if Macro Atoms being used.
	04Apr   SS      Modified to include a collisional cooling term
	                - this is getting very messy and confusing - I think
                        I should probably put together a completely separte
			set of routines for doing the heating and cooling in the
			macro atom cases. (SS) since this is now not really a
			total emission but total cooling.

Description:	
   Adiabatic cooling is clearly the amount of PdV work done by

Notes:

History:

  			if the routine is called it has no effect.  The
  			or more properly, one issue is how to meld adiabatic 
  			cooling with the macro atom approach.

Synopsis: one_ff(one, f1, f2)  determines the frequency of a 
	ff photon within the frequency interval f1 and f2

Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	

Notes:
	one is the windcell where the photon will be created.  It is needed
	only for the temperature.  ?? The code would be simplified
	if simply the temperature were transmitted.

History:
   98           ksl     coded as part of python effort
   98oct        ksl     Removed the internal frequency limits to assure 
			that total ff and one_ff were using
   			the same limits
