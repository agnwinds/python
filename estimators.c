Synopsis:
	bf_estimators_increment is the routine to increment the bound-free
	estimators as needed for the macro atom calculations. Whenever a packet
	travels a path length ds through a shell the estimator for all bound-free
	processes where the packet frequency is above the threshold frequency
	is incremented. The estimator is not normalised here. That is done later.

Arguments:

       WindPtr one                 pointer to cell
       PhotPtr p                   the packet
       double ds                   the path length

Returns:
       

Description:


Notes: The estimators are not normalised by this routine.
       This routine also now computes the total heating rate due
       to simple ions.  Therefore the routine needs to be called
       even for the simple non-macro atom case.

History:
          Mar 04  SS   Coding began.
          Apr 04  SS   Computation of heating rate due to simple ions added.
          Apr 04  SS   Computation of heating rate due to ff added.
          May 04  SS   Added lines for macro_simple option (i.e. treat all ions
                       as simple)
          Sep 04  SS   Modified to record energy absorped by macro atom levels and k-packets.

	comes into resonance with a line this routine is called WHETHER OR NOT

Returns:

Description:


Notes: The estimators are not normalised by this routine
       For the moment, the increment to the estimator is taken to be
       weight * (1 - exp(-tau))/ tau / dvds
       This is slightly different from what I do in my code (not
       accurate to v/c corrections). If calculations where accuracy to
       order v/c is needed then this routine should be improved.

Synopsis:
	mc_estimator_normalise (n) is the routine to normalise the 
	bb and bf estimators. It is performed as part of the wind update stage
	of Python. The estimators should only be changed during the ionisation
	cycles - after that they should be fixed. 

Arguments:

       w            WindPtr
       n            the cell for which the normalisation is to be done

Returns:
       

Description:


Notes: This routine normalises the bb and bf mc estimators needed
       for the macro atom jumping probabilities. During the main mc
       simulation these were stored unnormalised. They are now
       normalised and moved into the "old" slots for use in the next
       iteration. The current slots are reset to zero for use in the
       next iteration.

       It also now computes the bf heating rate using the normalised
       estimators. heat_tot and heat_photo are incremented but nothing else
       is for now.

       ksl -- This routine loops over nlte_levels, which in principle
       could include non-macro ions, but that should not matter since
       since nbfu_jumps will be zero for these.

Synopsis: total_fb_matoms computes the cooling rate due to free-bound
	recombinations using mc estimators. It is modelled on total_fb
	but makes use of the mc estimators for stimulated recombination.

Arguments:

       ww            WindPtr
       t_e           electron temperature
       f1            lower frequency
       f2            upper frequency

Returns:
       

Description:


Notes: This returns the cooling rate for bf recombination.

       ksl -- This routine loops over nlte_levels, which in principle
       could include non-macro ions, but that should not matter since
       since nbfu_jumps will be zero for these.

History:
          Mar 04  SS   Coding began.
          Jun 04  SS   Modified to include the cooling due to
                       collisional ionization.
	04Jul	ksl	Modified calls to alpha_sp to reflect
			fact that alpha_sp has been generalized
			to cover the energy averaged and 
			spontaneous case.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Modified to use plasma structure
			Uses volume so did not delete Wind structure
			but if we put volume in both places could do this
