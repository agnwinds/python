### Extended

The parameter files in this directory are (should represent) valid parameter files 
for use with Python that typically take longer to run than the simple models in the basic
subdirectry.  As such they may require more computing resources than is available on a typical
workstation or laptop.  

Some of them are parameter files, or new versions of the parameter files 
for models used in various papers.  

Some simply involve options that are not commonly used with Python
