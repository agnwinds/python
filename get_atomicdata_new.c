Synopsis:
 	get_atomic_data(masterfile) is a generalized subroutine for reading atomic data 
 	into a set of structures defined in "atomic.h"   (Space for the structures is 
	also allocated in this routine. 
   
 
  
Arguments:
	masterfile is a file which contains the names of the files which will be read
	as atomic data.  (This allows one to group the atomic data into logical units.)

Returns:
 
 
Description:	
	get_atomic_data reads in all the atomic data.  It also converts the data to cgs units unless
	otherwise noted, e.g ionization potentials are converted to ergs.  
	
	The order of the data is important.  Elements should be defined before ions; ions
	before levels, levels before  lines etc.  In most if not all cases, one can either define all 
        of the elements first, all of the ions, etc ... or the first element and its ions, the 
        second element and its ions etc. Commenting out an element in the datafile has the effect of
	eliminating all of the data associated with that element, e.g ions, lines, etc.

	The program assumes that the ions for a given element are grouped together,
        that the levels for a given element are grouped together, etc.  

	If one wants to read both Topbase and VFKY photoionization x-sections, then the topbase
	x-sections should be read first.  The routine will ignore data in the VFKY list if there
	is a pre-existing Topbase data.  The routine will stop if you but a VFKY x-section first
	on the assumption that Topbase data should trump VFKY data. (Making the program more flexible
	would be difficult because you would have to drop various bits of Topbase data out of the 
        middle of the structure or mark it NG or something.)

	Similarly, as a general rule the macro information should be provided before the simple
	ions are described, and the macro lines should be presented before simple lines.  

	The only data which can be mixed up completely is the line array.
	
	Finally, get_atomic_data creates a pointer array to  lines, which has the lines in 
	frequency ascending order.   This is actually done by a small subroutine index_lines
	which in turn calls a Numerical Recipes routine.
		
Notes:
	NOTHING IN THESE ROUTINES SHOULD SPECIFIC TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE ATOMIC DATA 
	IS TO BE USED.  Specifically nothing here should be specific to the Monte Carlo calculations
	for which the routines were written. These routines are just ways to read in the atomic data 

	For completeness the macro atom information should be probably be printed to the data file,
	or alteranatively the printing to the data file should be eliminated altogether as a waste
	of time -- ksl 
History:
 	97jan	ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort.  
 	97oct2	ck	Added steps to read in recombination fractions
 	98feb27	ksl	Revised photoionization inputs so now use Verner, Ferland, Korista, & Yakolev
 			formalism
 	98apr4	ksl	Modified to read multiplicites of lower and upper states of resonance lines, and
 			to exclude lines in which the oscillator strengths or frequencies etc were zero
 	98may23	ksl	Corrected error which allowed ions to be read for which there were no elements.
 			Also fixed initialization of phot_info
	99jan4	ksl	Added code to keep track of the lowest frequency for which photoionization
			can occur (phot_freq_min).
	99nov28	ksl	Modified so that the datafiles it looks for are now in a subdirectory atomic.
			This follows the approach I have been adopting in other programs of putting
			data into a subdirectory of the program in which the program is being run.  This
			way one can merely link to the appropriate directory
	00nov27	ksl	Updated program to make it easier to consider different sets of atomic data
			Also converted program so that it would use the standard logging procedures.
        00nov28 ksl	Updated program to accept transitions which do not arise from ground states
	01jul11	ksl	Updated program to accept levels as produced by kurucz, using for example
			gfall.dat .  This was in preparation for incorporating some non-LTE aspects
			into python 
	01sep24	ksl	Updated program to define some levels to use in a non_lte calculation.  I
			assume that the number of levels to consider in non_lte is the last integer
			on the ion line.
	01sep24	ksl	Elimated use of foo_ion and foo_ele.  These were simply confusing.
	01sep25	ksl	Incorporated topbase levels and photoinization cross sections.
	01nov22	ksl	Hopefully sorted out all of the various read formats to allow for use
			of the output files of various programs in py_atomic.
	01dec12	ksl	Have split the configurations into to indentifiable groups, those which are
			to be treated on the fly -- aka LTE --  and those which in principle can
			be treated in detail -- aka non-LTE.  In practice, we are also making modifica-
			tions to the lines on the fly.  Any configureation with is "non-LTE" has space
			in the levden array for that ion.
	02jun	ksl	Converted all multiplicities from integers to doubles, since in some cases
			one may have non-integer g's and also to prevent gu/gl divisions from giving
			incorrect answer.
        04Feb19 SS      Made modifications to read atomic data in format suitable for the proposed implementation
                        of Macro Atoms. Modifications should preserve all the previous options and place Macro
                        Atoms data at top of hierarchy - i.e. other data read later should be ignored. 
        04Mar   SS      Minor changes (following suggestions of ksl). 
	04Apr	ksl	Added macro_info to lines, configs.  (1 is a line used by a macro atom, 0 is a line 
			that is not part of a macro atom.).  Simplified inputs so that when one reads IonM
			it is assumed to be a macro-ion.  If it is just Ion or IonV, then the assumption is that
			it is a "simple" ion
	04Dec	ksl	Made use of DEBUG to eliminate printout of many error in get_atomic_data that
			are really part of normal flow of program.  To print out these lines, set
			DEBUG to a nonzero value at top of program
	04dec	ksl	54a-Modified the macro atom reading portion of the program so that one can limit levels
			in the elements_ions section of the input and "seamlessly" avoid reading them in 
			elsewhere.  This makes the macro portion of the program consistent with the
			"simple" atom approach.
	04dec	ksl	54b-Added a bit clearer set of comments and reorganized a bit to collect all of the
			indexing in one place. There is no change in funtionality regarding this.
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Added if DEBUG lines so that data.out is not normally printed
	06jul	ksl	57+ -- Modified so that calloc is used to allocate space for structures
	06aug	ksl	57h -- Added checks to ensure that macro_info which is set to -1 in various
			of the structures, is set to 0 or 1 somewhere in the process.  This simplifies
			some of the switches in the program.  Note that I did not check for self-consitency
			just that the value is not -1, which it was initially.
	080810	ksl	62 -- Modified the way in which levels are read in.  Basically the routine assumes
			and prevents one from reading in more than one level type, e.g macro_atom, top_base
			record, kurucz record etc.  One cannot use more than one type anymore.  
	080812	ksl	62 -- Made additional changes to make sure photoionization records were only
			linked to levels for which the density could be calculated.  (Note, that there
			may be a problem if we decide to use topbase data for ions with 0 nlte levels
			allowed, i.e. zero levels in which we keep track of the density.  
        081115  nsh     70 -- added in structures and routines to read in data to implement
			dielectronic recombination.
	11dec	ksl	71 - Added calls to free memory and reallocate the atomic data structures if one calls this more
	12jun   nsh	72 - added structures and routines to read in partition function data from 
			cardona 2010
			than once
	12jul   nsh	73 - added structures and routines to read in badnell style total recombination rate data

//Ions
/* 

Until mid-2001, very little use was made of configurations or levels in Python
and hence the original ion specification contained no control parameters associated
with the configurations that would follow.

Hence the old style specified, the element, ion state, multiplicity, and
ionization potential in the following format:

Ion	C	6	1	3	11.26

The newer style adds two more variables

Ion	H	1	1	2	13.598   5 3

which correspond to the maximum number of LTE and nLTE configurations. 

?? Stuart uses the same actual format as the new style configuration, which has 
two additional variables for the number of LTE and nLTE configurations.  

1.  Given this, why does he create input lines that begin with IonV rather
than Ion. It might be simpler for now just to use this to declare we want this
particular ion to be part of the macro-levels.  The alternative, if one does
not want to proliferate types of keywords is to use a switch in the line.  

I have changed this aprt of the code so that it recognizes IonM as a macro-ion.

2.  Exactly how are the number of LTE and nLTE configurations used in the
code.  

One fundamental distinction is that space to store the populations of nlte 
levels are contained in the wind structure, whereas the lte exist as energy levels, 
in the atomic data files but the populations are not part of the wind structure.
It's clear therefore that macro-levels need to be nlte levels.

But it is pretty unclear how nlte levels from ksl's version are actually used.

//Levels or Configurations  
/* This version of get_atomicdata can read various types of configuration inputs, some of which should gradually be
exsized from the program.  Originally, the idea was that Levels would immediately follow an ion, and in that case
all that was need to describe a level, was a level number, a multiplicity, and an energy for the level.  An example
of this type of line follows:

Ion	He	2	1	1	24.587  6 2
Level 1 1 0.0
Level 2 3 19.819
It is a requirement that when an OLDSTYLE line is used, it must immediately follow the ion.

The second type of LEVEL style was developed solely to allow the levels to be disjoint from
the ions.  Disjoint in this case implies that the level must follow the ion, but it does not
have to be immediately after the ion line.

It was developed to allow one to use levels developed from the Kurucz
line list, and the new Verner level file.  

A typical KURUCZSTYLE record would look like:

Comment-- Ion H  1
# There are 17 unique levels for 1 1
Level   1   1   0    2   0.000000
Level   1   1   1    2  10.200121
Level   1   1   2    4  10.200166
Level   1   1   3    2  12.089051

where the colums are z, istate (in conventianal notation), a unique level no,
the multiplicity of the level and the exitation energy of the level in eV


NOTE: Historically (prior to Oct2001) Levels were of miminimal importance to Python

The new Topbase style records (created by py_parse_levels) look like this:

2     NZ  the atomic number of the level
3     NE  the ionization state according to the usual astronomical convention.  Note

	program.
4   iSLP  A coded version of the angular momentum

Macro Atoms (SS)

When the macro atom method is to be used the level data should look like:
e.g.

#         z ion lvl ion_pot   ex_energy  g  rad_rate
LevMacro  1  1  1 -13.605698   0.000000  2  1.00e+21 () n=1

LevMacro  1  2  1   0.000000  13.605698  1  1.00e+21 () cnt


The details are:

Col
2      Atomic number 
3      Ionisation state (usual astronomical convention: neutral=1)
4      An index for the level: this index must be assigned consistently in all
       the macro input files (i.e. also in photoionisation data)
       Each level index in a particular ion must be unique.
5      ionisation potential (electron volts)
6      excitation energy (electron volts). A consistent definition of energy=0
       must be used for all ions of the same element: ground state energy for the
       neutral species = 0.
7      statistical weight
8      radiative lifetime
9      a string giving a name for the level (not used by code)

// Photoionization
/* 
Until at least Oct 2001, Python used photoionization crossections from Verner, Ferland, Korista, and Yakolev (DFKY)
The routine sigma_phot(xptr, freq) calculates the crossection based on this.

The original topbase records look like this
 ================================================
       I  NZ  NE  ISLP  ILV        E(RYD)      NP
 ================================================
       1   2   1   200    1  -4.00000E+00     101
  3.960000E+00 1.619E+00
  4.000000E+00 1.576E+00
  4.101260E+00 1.474E+00
  4.205084E+00 1.379E+00
  4.311536E+00 1.289E+00
  4.420684E+00 1.206E+00

They are converted to something that is more compatible with Topbase 
by py_top_phot

The new topbase style records look like this.  

PhotTopS  2  1 200    1    54.422791 101
PhotTop    54.422791 1.576e-18
PhotTop    66.508772 9.197e-19
PhotTop    78.594753 5.817e-19
PhotTop    90.680734 3.906e-19
PhotTop   102.766715 2.746e-19
PhotTop   114.852696 2.001e-19
PhotTop   126.938677 1.502e-19
PhotTop   139.024658 1.155e-19
PhotTop   151.110639 9.057e-20

The main changes from the original records are that energy levels
have been converted to eV, cross sections to cm**2, and the electron
number has been converted to conventional astronomical notiation
for the ionstate.

2    Atomic Number
3    Ionisation stage (astronomical convention)
4    Wavelength of transition (AA)
5    oscillator strength
6    stat. weight for lower level of transition
7    stat. weight for upper level of transition
8    energy of lower level of transition (eV)
9    energy of upper level of transition (eV)
10   index for lower level of transition (MUST match the index assigned to this level in
     level data
11   index for upper level of transition (MUST match the index assigned to this level in
     level data

  04dec ksl -- I have modified the next section to try to conform to the "philosophy" of
  get_atomic_data which is that one does not need to modify the more detailed files, e.g
  the LinMacro file, if one has eliminated a particular level in the elements ion file.  
  Basically this was accomplished by checking both the upper and lower level and breaking 
  out if either was not accounted for.

 Synopsis:
	limit_lines(freqmin,freqmax)  sets the the current values of line_min and line_max in atomic.h  
	which can be used to limit the lines searched for resonances to a specific 
	frequency range.
   
Arguments:		
	double freqmin, freqmax  a range of frequencies in which one is interested in the lines

Returns:
	limit_lines returns the number of lines that are potentially in resonance.  If limit_lines 
	returns 0 there are no lines of interest and one does not need to worry about any 
	resonaces at this frequency.  If limit_lines returns a number greater than 0, then 
	the lines of interest are defined by nline_min and nline_max (inclusive) in atomic.h
	nline_delt is also set which is the number of lines that are in the specified range

Description:	
	limit_lines  define the lines that are close to a given frequency.  The degree of closeness
	is defined by v. The routine must be used in conjuction with get_atomic_data which 
	will have created an ordered list of the lines.   
Notes:
	Limit_lines needs to be used somewhat carefully.  Carefully means checking the
	return value of limit_lines or equivalently nline_delt=0.  If nline_delt=0 then there
	were no lines in the region of interest.  Assuming there were lines in thte range,
	one must sum over lines from nline_min to nline_max inclusive.  
	
	One might wonder why nline_max is not set to one larger than the last line which
	is in range.  This is because depending on how the velocity is trending you may
	want to sum from the highest frequency line to the lowest.

?? It is unclear to me whether given that limit lines is very similar 
from call to call
that it would not be more efficeint to expand from previous 
limits rather than adopt the approach hre 02may

History:
 	97jan      ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort.  
 	98apr4	ksl	Modified inputs so one gives freqmin and freqmax directly
	01nov	ksl	Rewritten to handle large numbers of lines more
			efficiently
