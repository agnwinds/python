  Synopsis:
  	The routines here provide a way to read grids of models and
	then to interpolate between them.

	There are two main routines

		get_models (modellist, npars, spectype)

	which reads a list of models

	and
		model (spectype, par)

	which given a set of parameters will interpolate between modles
	given the set of models one wants to interpolate betwee, which
	is determined by spectype, and the set of parameters (par) that
	define the models
 

  History:
	13jul	ksl	Added these notes about the purpose of the routines in this file

  Synopsis:

	get_models (modellist, npars, spectype)


  Description:	These are a generic set of routines to read a grid or grids
	of models, e.g. a set of Kurucz stellar atmospheres which can
	used to simulate a disk, given a run of temperature and gravity
   	
	
	The grid can be any reasonable number of dimension

  Arguments:		
     char modellist[];		// filename containing location and associated parameters of models
     int npars;			// Number of parameters which vary for these models

     The modellist is an ascii file listing one model on each line of the file. Comments
     lines begining with # are ignored.  For example

     kurucz91/fp00t4000g30k2c125.txt         4000          3.0

     refers to a Kurucz model with a temperature of 4000 K and a log gravity of 3.0


  Returns:
     int *spectype;		//  The returned spectrum type 

     spectype really is just an integer that is incremented each time a new set of models
     is read in.  

  Notes:
	DO NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT GENERIC HERE!  

	The models general are also ascii files with wavelengths and fluxes (flambda
	or something proportional to flambda, although since the routine is generic
	that is not something that is enforced by this routine.  

	For 1d models we assume the models are read in increasing order of
	the parameter of interest.  

	2 or more parameter models can be read in any order.  Bilinear interpolation
	is done for the 2 parmeter models (as long as the grid is fully filled).
	To deal with cases in which the grid is not fully filled, we follow 
	the same approach as for get_hub, i.e. for parameters t and g (i.e.
	the first parameter being t, and the second g., we first search the grid
	for all models with t just below (above) the desired value.  We then 
	interpolate on g for the model just below, and on g for the model just
	above, and finally interpolate between these two.  
	The algorithm for interpolating between models 


	Note that each time a new set of models is read in, the spectype is
	incremented.

	These routines were originally parrt of as set of routines, kslfit,  intended
	to fit UV models to UV spectra. Subsequently, 080t17, the kslfit routines of the
	same name were modified and so the two sets of routines are no longer
	in sync, even though they have the same name.

  Synopsis:  model interpolates between models and places the results in 
  	comp[spectype].xmod

  Description:	

  Arguments:		

  Returns:
  	Returns nwaves in the the spectrum if a new spectrum was calculated
	0 if it was the old spectrum.

  Notes:

  This routine has always been a kluge. In 02aug, I have attempted to improve it.
  The problem has always been what to do in situations where the model grid does
  not fill out a regular, rectangular grid in parameter space.  This arises, for 
  example, in a model grid of stellar atmospheres with T & g, since the range of
  g for which a model can be calculated (i.e. for which Tlusty converges) depends 
  on T.  

  The solution which I try to implement in the new version of the code is to attempt
  to find where models should exist in a completely filled grid.  By completely filled,
  I mean that if you are fitting t and g, you will have 4 models which are just 
  above and below the desired t and g, e.g. mod(t1,g1), mod(t1,g2), mod(t2,g1), 
  mod(t2,g2).  In that case we carry out bi-linear interpolation to find the
  weights.  The problem arises when mod(t2,g2) does not exist.

  The "practical" solution this routine now implements is to ignore the missing model,
  treating each of the others as if bi-linear interpolation was being used, and
  then renormalizing to make sure the weights of the models that one does have
  sum to 1.  The solution is "practical" because it always gives a result, and
  because it gives the an appropriate answer when the grid is filled.  It is also
  easily extensible to more than two dimensions.  But it should be noted, the
  approach is also dangerous.

  History:
04aug	ksl	Adapted from similar routine used by kslfit.  In this
		case the results are placed in comp[spectype]xmod
06jul	ksl	57g -- fixed bug when trying to retrieve the best model
		when the first parameter (T) was exactly at a model value
		but this modeld would be excluded by the gravity calculation.
		Also did a little clean-up of comments
