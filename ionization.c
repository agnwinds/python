 Synopsis:
 	ionization routines for the wind one cell at a time
	
 Arguments:		
	WindPtr w;

Returns:
 
Description:	
	The intent is that the routine ion_abundances is the steering routine for
	all calculations of the abundances
	
Notes:

History:
	98jul	ksl	Incorporated Christians mods with my comments 
	98nov	ksl	Created the steering routine ion_abundances
	00jan	ksl	Homogenized calls so that ionization_mod_on_the_spot
			and ionization_mod_on_the_spot_exact do not call the
			entire wind structure.  NOTE THAT THESE LAST ROUTINES
			HAVE NOT BEEN SERIOUSLY RECHECKED, SINCE THEY ARE NOT
			MUCH USED.
	00jan	ksl	Moved ionization_mod_on_the_spot and ionization_mod_on_the_spot_exact
			to "Legacy code" Legacy1.c
	01oct	ksl	Add calls to levels for calculation of level populations.  The
			calls are currently hardwired.
	08aug	ksl	60b	Evidently ksl modified the calls to ion_abundances
				previously, but leaving w as the variable was
				confusing.  Fixed this
	080808	ksl	62  - Removed option 4 for a partial detailed balance
			which seems totally obsolete at this point as
			we have not followed this up.  This was part of
			the cleanup of the ionizaton balance routines
			Also removed option 5, as this was not supported
			later in the program
	11nov	ksl	71 - Moved the so-called Sim power law approximation
			to its own routine to restore this routine to its intent 
			to be a steering routine and not something with a lot
			of code particular to one calculation
        12feb   nsh	71c - added options for mode 6 and 7, the two new ioinzation
			codes that compute saha abundances for pairs of ions, based on a
			good temperature for that pair, then corrects.

	The routine attempts to determine whether a cell is
	on the track to a final solution by checking whether 
	the electron and radiation temperatures are getting 
	smaller with cycle and whetehr the difference between
	heating and cooling is drroping.

	The routine returns a number between 0 and 3, 
	depending on the number of convergence checks that
	are passed.  If all convergence tests are pssed
	then the number returned will be 0

	The routine also adjust the gain which controls how

/* calc_te determines and returns the electron temperature in the wind such that the energy emitted
   by the wind is equal to energy emitted.

   Description:
   calc_te does not modify any abundances.  It simply takes the current value of the heating in the
   cell and attempts to find the value of the electron temperature which will result in cooling which
   matches the heating.

   This approach is not entirely self consistent because if te is actually different then the
   abundances will be different and the heating will change as well.

   This routine is a kluge because it does not really deal with what happens if the cooling curve 
   has maxima and minima.
