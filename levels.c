  Synopsis:
	levels (xplasma, mode) calculates the fractional occupation numbers of
	the various levels of atomic configurations as designated in
	the atomic data files

  Description:

	mode	0	LTE with t_r
		1	LTE with t_e
		2	Non-LTE (reduced by weighted BB)

  Arguments:

  Returns:

  Notes:

	0808 - ksl - levels populates the levden array in the Plasma pointer.  It
		is called from ion_abundances in python, and is called directly
		from my diagnostic routine balance.  It's closely related to
		another but separate routine which calculates the partition
		functions, callled partition

  History:
	01sep23	ksl	Began work
	01oct10	ksl	Modified so modes matched python ionization modes
			more exactly.
	01dec03	ksl	Modified to simplify so modes match those of
			nebular concentrations
	01dec12	ksl	Modified to react to changes which split "nlte"
			and "lte" levels.  Levels is explicitly for so-
			called "nlte" levels, which are tracked in the
			Wind structure
	04Apr   SS      If statement added to avoid this routine changing
                        macro atom level populations.
        04May   SS      The if statment added above is modified for the case
                        of all "simple" ions.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Modified to make use of plasma structue
	080810	ksl	62 - Fixed problem with how the levden array was
			indexed.  The problem was that the index into the
			levden array is not the same as the index into
			the so called nlte configurations.
			Also made the actual use of variables
			like nion,n,m resemble that in partitions so the
			routine was easier to compae
