Notes:

History:
 	97jun	ksl	Coding on py_wind began.
 	98feb	ksl	Coding of these subroutines began.
 	98apr25	ksl	Added checks in several routines to fix problems when the maximum freq
 				was less than the minimum frequency
 	98nov	ksl	Corrected various bugs associated with line heating, and modified to incorporate
			pdf's in line heating.  This change was desirable to speed the program when
			large numbers of lines are in the line list, because it cuts down the times
			the power of a line or set of lines is calculated..

/* Calculate the total line emission from a wind cell

   History:
	98	ksl	Coded
	98aug29	ksl	Removed code which limits calculation to strong lines.  This calculation
			had the effect of eliminating all line emission at low density (10**8) under
			certain situations.  As a result, line emission and line absorption were not
			guaranteed to balance in conditions that were supposed to approach lte 
	98nov25	ksl	Corrected formulae to properly account for stimulated emission.
	99jan	ksl	Added limits to avoid calculation of extremely weak lines in
			attempt to speed up program.  Note that this is fairly dangerous

scattering fraction(line_ptr,ne,te,dd,dvds,w,tr) calculate the fraction of excited 
state atoms which correspond to scattered photons, i.e. the portion which are
excited by radiation and return to the ground state via spontaneous emission.

Description:

In the radiative transfer equation for lines, we separate the fraction of photons
which are "absorbed" and the fraction which are "scattered".  

If line_mode==0, the atomosphere is a completely absorbing and no photons
		will be scattered.  In this mode, assuming the wind is a source
		of emission, the emissivity will be the Einstein A coefficient
If line_mode==1, the atmosphere is completely scattering, there will be no
		interchange of energy between the photons and the electrons
		as a result of radiation transfer
If line_mode==2, then a simple single scattering approximation is applied in which
		case the scattered flux is just  A21/(C21+A21*(1-exp(-h nu/k T_e). 
If line_mode==3, then radiation trapping is included as well.  The basic idea
		is to calculate the average number of scatters in a single
		interaction and there is heat lost in each of these scatters.
Notes: 
	It may be more efficient to combine several of these routines in view
	of the fact that the exp is calculated several times

History:
	98	ksl	Coded
	98aug	ksl	Rewritten to allow for stimulated decays in a
			two-level atom population.  Also rewrote the
			radiative trapping section.  It was clearly not
			correct previously! But is it correct now???
	98nov	ksl	Corrected scattering fraction to agree with Python notes.
			It was not correct previously
