 Synopsis:
 
 	These are a series of routines which are designed to generate a random sampling
 	of a probability distribution using cumulative distribution functions.
 	
 	The main routines are
 	
		pdf_gen_from_func	(&pdf,&func,xmin,xmax,njumps,jump)		
			Generate a cumulative distrubution function (cdf) from a function
 	          
		pdf_gen_from_array(&pdf,x,y,n_xy,xmin,xmax,njumps,jump)		
			Generate a cumulative distribution function (cdf) from an
 			array of values

		pdf_get_rand(&pdf)				
			Generate a single sample from a cdf defined by either of the first
 			two routines 	
 	
 	Sometimes it is expensive computationally to recalculate the distribution function
 	every time you change the limits.   An example of this is the distribution function
 	for a bb where the distribution function is quite smooth (and can be represented in a 
 	dimensionless manner) but calculating the function and the distribution function
 	can be expensive.  The following two routines allow one to sample a part of a
 	pdf.  Note that pdf_gen-from_func or pdf_gen_from_array should have been
 	called previously!
 
		pdf_limit(&pdf,xmin,xmax)  sets limit1 and limit2 so that one can generate
 			distributions from a limited range within a previously created pdf.

		pdf_get_rand_limit(&pdf) will samples the pdf but limits the range of
			the return to lie between xmin and xmax from pdf_limit.

	
	There are some internal routines

		gen_array_from_func (func, xmin, xmax, pdfsteps) generates a cdf from a function
			on values linearly spaced between xmin and xmax.  pdfsteps gies the
			number of points.

 	There is also a simple diagnostic routine
		pdf_check(&pdf)

	which returns a nonzero number if certain checks of the pdf fail
	and a routine  

		pdf_to_file(&pdf,filename)				
 		  	to write a pdf structure to a file


								
Arguments for pdf_gen_from_func
	PdfPtr pdf;		A ptr to a pdf structure (see below)
	double (*func)()	The probablility density function to be integrated 
				to create the pdf
	double xmin,xmax;	The range over which the function is to be 
				integrated
	double jump[];		Specifix values of x, perhaps a Lyman edge, to be
				included in the pdf_structure.  These must be in
				ascending order but do not have to lie between xmin
				and xmax
	int njumps;		The size of jumps[]

Arguments for pdf_gen_from_array are same as above except
 	
	double x[],y[]		The one dimensional arrays containg the places x where the cumulative 
				distribution function density has been evaluated.  The array need not 
				be uniformly spaced. y is the value of the cdf at the point x 
	double d[]		The rate of change of the probability density at x, which is calculated
				from the CDF. -- Added 57i
	int n_xy		The size of x[] and y[]

Arguments for pdf_get_rand
	PdfPtr pdf		pdf (See below)	is a structure which contains the cumulative
				distribution function.

Arguments for pdf_limit
	double xmin,xmax	Here xmin and xmax will cause pdf[].limit1 and pdf[].limit2 to be set
				in such a way that when you call pdf_get_rand_limit the distribution
				will be sampled only between xmin and xmax.  Watch out though
				because if xmin and xmax lie outside of the original value of xmin
				and xmax then the distribution will not extend this far.							
Arguments for pdf_to_file
	PdfPtr pdf
	char filename[]		If you can't figure this out, you are in deep trouble!
				
Returns:
	All of the routines return 0 on successful completion, except pdf_get_rand which returns
	a random value between xmin and xmax.  Multiple calls to pdf_get_rand should regenerate
	the probability density function.
	
	If there is an error the routines usually send an error message to the screen and logfile
	and cause the program to stop!  Occasionally the program will send a nonzero return to
	indicate an error.
 
Description:

	The purpose of these routines is first to generate a cumulative distribution function
	and then allow one to sample that distribution function.  The procedure is either
	to call pdf_gen_from_func if you have a function whose probability distribution you
	want (as might be the case if you were generating bremsstrahlung photons and you knew
	the formula)  or pdf_gen_from_array (as might be the case if you were trying to
	generate Monte Carlo spectra from precalculated Kurucz models).
	
	The result of calling either of these routines will be to populate a structure of
	the form Pdf
		pdf->x[]  will contain NPDF values of x between xmin and xmax.  The values will be
			spaced so that it is almost but not quite true that if you generate a uniform
			number n between 0 and NPDF you could just read off the value pdf[n].x and
			that by doing this multiple times you could regenerate the distribution function
		pdf->y[]  will contain values between 0 and 1 and is the integral of the cumulative
			distribution function from xmin to pdf[].x
			
	Once a pdf has been generated, one samples the pdf by calls to pdf_get_rand which 
	creates a random number between 0 and 1, finds the elements in pdf which surround
	the random number and interpolates to return a value x. 
	
	It is possible to force specific values of x to appear in the pdf.  This is desirable
	if there are edges where the probability density changes rapidly, as for example
	at the Lyman edge in a stellar spectrum.  By using jumps properly you can assure
	that edges will be sharp in the regenerated distribution (since otherwse pdf_get_rand
	will linearly interpolate between two points on the opposite sides of the edge).

Notes:
	Must be compiled with log.c since it makes use of the "python" logging routines for
	errors.

	The fact that these routines start with pdf... is historical and represents a poor
	choice of nomenclature.  We reallly mean comulative distribution functions

	It would probably be desirable to modify this so that the size of the parallel 
	arrays being generated could be determined from inside the program.  In that case
	NPDF would have to become the maximum size.


	Error??: For Kurucz models, The probability distribution beyond the He edge  
	is often very peaked at the long wavelength end and rapidly changing.  In this 
	instance, some bizarre results can be obtained because NPDF is not enough to 
	properly populate the pdf.  One could increase NPDF, but this would slow 
	everything down.  This is an another argument that the whole routine pdf_gen_from_array
	neeeds to be rewritten to avoid using NPDF altogether.  One way to do this
	would be simply to use the values of x and y in creating an inital pdf.  There
	is however a question of resampling.
	

History:
	97aug	ksl 	Initial versions of these and similar routines coded as part of python project.
	98mar	ksl	Recoded all of the pdf routines so that jumps were incorporated and so
			that they all use the pdf structure. 
	98mar25	ksl	Fixed a problem with gen_from_func which occured when there were
			discontinues changes in the pdf which resulted in multiple values of
			the pdf being associated with the same probability.  Also, fixed I had
			not done proper accounting when there were specific values at which
			I want the pdf recorded. 
	98jul27	ksl	Fixed a problem with renormalization inf pdf_gen_from_func for the case when
			one wanted the pdf at specific values.  Discovered, and have fixed a problem
			in pdf_gen_from_array and pdf_gen_from_func associated with requireing the
			pdf at specific values.  Note: while I have tested this for pdf_gen_from func
			I have not really tested it for pdf_gen_from_array and this needs to be done.!!
			Added a routine pdf_check which looks for errors in a pdf_array.
	98jul27 ksl	Added check to assure that if one does put in points at specific values
                        that the probability density was not zero over this interval which would
                        produce two y values that are exactly the same.	
	00dec30	ksl	Fixed small error to change order of truth calculation in a while statement that
			was causing the program to fail on Proga's alpha
	06sep	ksl	57i -- Previously, one assumed the probability density was effectively
			uniform between the places where the cumulative distribution function
			was calculated.  Now we attempt to make a correction for this.
	06oct	ksl	58 -- After a lot of testing, I decided to baseline the version
			of pdf that makes a first order correction for non-uniformity of
			the probability distribution within intervals where the cdf is
			calculated.  The version here corresponds to 57ib.  I still don't understand
			some of the timing issues associated with this, as there are circumstances
			where this more excact calculation seems to take less time to exeucute
			in python than the old version.  The old version should still be in the
			directory (and is called pdf_uniform.c)
	10oct	ksl	Changed the way in wich pdf_gen_from function works so it will change the
			the number of points that are used in the array pdf_array in situations
			where the binning is too course.  In the process, eliminated pdf_init.  
			It was only called by one routine.

/* 

gen_array_from_func


This is a routine which is called by pdf_gen_from_func which simply calculates the cumulative
distribution of the function in equally spaced steps between xmin and xmax.  The CDF is properly
normalized.


pdfsteps is the number of steps that are calculated.  The routine returns the largest change
in the cdf between any two points in the grid.

Notes:

10oct - ksl -This is rather brute force.  An alternative would have been to have increased the density of points
only in the region where it was needed.  This could be done by looking at the regions where the
sampling was poor in the initial calculation and addeding new points in in a new calculations.  But
this would require one to pass both the values of the CDF and the positions where the values were
taken.  This would be  not be hard but would require more extensive modifications to pdf_gen_from func than 
currently.  

11jun	ksl	The name of this function is rather misleading reflecting its history.  At one point
		it simple generated the value of the function at the various points in the grid.  That
		is no longer the case, and has led to confusion.

Notes:


	06sep -- There are differences between this and pdf_gen_from_func
	that look historical -- ksl


History:
	98jul	ck	Added check to see if pdf, really cdf, is all zeros
	98jul27 ksl	Changed the logic in the way the pdf array is created.  
			The old method was not correct.  
	02jul	ksl	Rewrote much of routine to try to handle situations in
			which the array implied a distribution which was very skewed 
			toward either end. Specifically, I eliminated the old approach
			that did a pseudo integration along the lines of the one
			in pdf_gen_from_func. The new approach should also speed the
			routine up significantly, and eliminate some of the other
			errors which have plagued earlier versions, e.g. non-monotonic
			pdfs and values just out of bounds.  (See the comments in
			python_43/pdf.c)
	04mar	ksl	A familiar problem of the pdf being out of order appeared 
			in pdf_gen_from_array when I increased the number of 
			elements in the pdf array.  I found an error in the way q 
			for jumps was calculated and added checks (and a shuffle)
			for situations where the cdf was out of order.
	090122	ksl	Increase size of PDF_ARRAY to reflect the fact that we are
			tending towards models with more points in them and updated 
			the error message associated with allowing too few points
			so that problems with this would be easier to update in
			future.

Description:

	Calculate the pdf form a cdf 
	allow one to calculate a first order correction
	to a uniform distibution between the points
	where the gradient has been calculated.
                                                                                             
Notes:

	d is calculated by differencing the cdf.  Thus
	this routine should work both for cdf's calculated
	from functions and from arrays
