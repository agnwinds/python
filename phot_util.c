Synopsis:
   ds_to_cone (cc, p) This is a new version of ds_to_cone introduced in order to 
   allow cylvar coordianates  Eventually it is intended to replace ds_to_windcone 
   completely, or at least the guts of ds_to_windcone.

Description:
                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                            
Notes:

As part of the conversion, the old ds_to_cone was renamed to ds_to_windcone
   


	56d -- Cones have become more prominent in python with time.  Originally
	they were used simply to define the inner and outer edges of the
	wind, that is   to determine when a photon entered the wind.  The wind was/is 
	assumed to be a biconical flow, and therefore the most naturally was defined in
	terms of a footpoint in the disk for the innermost/outermost stream line
	and a slope.  
	
	It was expanced when rtheta coordanates were introduced
	to handle find when one had hit the theta coordinate boundaries.  And in
	56d we also want it to handle the case where the grid cells have variable
	z coordinates.  Therefore one needs to be quite careful, Since ds_to_cone
	is the ultimate name of the routine I would like to use, the first step
	I took was to change the name of the old routine to ds_to_windcone.  This
	should allow me to replace the old routine incrementally.  

	56d -- With python 56d the variable defining a cone were changed to be
	the point on the z axis intercepted by the cone (extended) through 
	the disk, and the slope.

	Our approach is as follows:

	The cone is defined by  z=z_o + dz/drho *drho
	The photon is defined by X=X_o + LMN s

	Unless dz/drho = 0, this turns into a simple quadratic equation that must
	be solved.  We work in the northen hemisphere only.
       
	There are issues concerning what to do so one crosses the disk plane.  For
        finding how far a photon can travel in a cell, we are *not* interested 
	in the possibility that the photon hits the cone on the other side of
	the disk plane, but for a photon travelling out of the wind we are 
	very interested in this possibility.	

History:
	05jul	ksl	Created so that cylvar coordinates could be incorporated
			into python.
	06sep	ksl	57h -- Corrected an error discovered by SS in the seup of the
			quadratic for a cone.  Note that if this routing ever became
			a "heavy hitter" in terms of efficiency, there are a few
			changes that could speed it up a bit since the magnitude
			of lmn is always 1.
