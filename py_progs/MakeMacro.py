"""
Uses Chianti and Topbase to create the base for macro-atom models.

Use Chianti and Topbase to create a set of data files that
can be used as the basis for creating macro-atom models of various ions


Command line usage (if any):

    usage::

        MakeHMacro.py ion_name nlevels [True]

    where the ion name is in Chianti notation, e.g c_4 for C IV, fe_25 for Fe XXV and
    nlevels is the number of energy levels to include in the model

    and the optional True implies this is the top ion to include.  
    
    * Changes as per 27/08/20
    
    usage (in terminal window)::

        MakeMacro.py ion_name nlevels True/False

Description:  

    This routine uses ChiantiPy to access the Chianti database for level line 
    and collision information about an ion.  It attempts to create MacroAtom versions level and line 
    and collision files from the Chianti data  Then the routine retrieves (if necessary) the TopBase 
    photoinization data from Vizier, and constructs photoinization x-sections files that match
    the level files.  

    As currently constructed the routine (attaches a line for the next ion up to the level file) so that
    if one trying to use these data with multiple ions, one needs to make sure to remove all but the
    highest ion+1 line.  As an example suppose you want to construct a model for CIII, CIV, and CV.
    Then one must remove the last line from the level 5 for c_3 and c_4 but not c_5.  

Primary routines:

    doit is the routine run from the command line, and creates all of the data needed for a single 
    ion

Notes:

    There is no guarantee that the file that is produced will be a file that one wants from a physical
    perspective so this routine should be used with great care.  

    In order for this program to work, one must have Chianti and ChiantiPy properly installed on your
    machine.

# because Python expects a photionzation x-section for each level
#
# Alternatively, I suspect you can combine some of the levels into a single simpler level, if you know how to modify
# various factors, e.g g, and you make some kind of assumption about what you need to do interms of adding f together.

# In exploring the collisions in Chianti, I discovered that for H at least here are collisions strengths for between levels that do not have lines assoicated with them.  I am not sure why that is, but it must affect macro atoms, and it did it might be needed.  A simple join between the lines file and the collisions files reveals those that have both, but a left join easily shows you the ones that are just collision data

    the collision x-section.  (This probably dates back to simple atoms, where lines are used
