This is a program that is designed to expand a .pf file into a grid of .pf files.


Usage:

    Use::

        pf_grid.py base.pf

    where base.pf is a correctly formatted parameter file, with variables that one
    wishes to grid indicated by ?

Description:  

    This program was written for creating grids of models with  Python
    python, although it should work with any .pf file in the case where one
    wants to run a grid of models.  As an example this should be a reasonable way
    to do much of the setup work for runing a bunch of ISM calculations.

    To use the program take a .pf file which is correctly formatted to run with python.
    This is going to be the basis of all of the .pf files.  Replace the values of those
    variables you want to grid with $

    Run the program. It will ask for the .pf file, herafter grid.pf, to use, 
    and a basename for all of the output files.  It will read through grid.pf and 
    will ask the user to give the values of each of the variables to grid. 

    The format of the inputs is very specific, and not particularly user-friendly! 
    (The lines are read with the input or in Python 3 the raw_input command in python, 
    the scripting language'.  
    
    The two possibities that are supported by the program are:
    
    #. a list format which means one must enclose everything in [], e.g. [14,27,32]
       which would say that for this variable you want values of 14, 27, and 32.
    
    #. a special format to create a logarithminc grid of variables, e.g. log_ints(xmin,xmax,n)
       where xmin and xmax are the minimum and maximum values of the variable in
       question and n is the number of variables.  Note that you enter the
       actual values of xmin and xmax and not the log of this.  For example::

            log_ints(1.e16.,1.e18.,3)

       will end up produciing a list with variables [1.e16,1.e17,1.e18]

       Note also that this input is treated within the routine as a function,
       and so here the inputs have to be enclosed in parentheses.


Returns:

    The program produces a lot of files:

    a file which lists what was varied and the values for them.  The name of this file
    is the same as basename, with a .ls extensition attached, e.g vwhyi.ls
    This is intended for use with a fitting program::

        # Variable Disk.mdot(msol/yr)
        # Variable Wind.mdot(msol/yr)
        PYGRID/vwhyi_0000.spec     1e-08     1e-09 
        PYGRID/vwhyi_0001.spec     1e-08   2.2e-09 
        PYGRID/vwhyi_0002.spec     1e-08   4.6e-09 
        ... 
    
    a file which can run python for the grid, one model after another.  This has the prefix
    `Run_` and the remainder is the basename, e.g something like, `Run_vwhyi`.  It begins
    something like::

        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        py vwhyi_0000
        py vwhyi_0001
        py vwhyi_0002
        py vwhyi_0003
        py vwhyi_0100
        ...

    A number of .pf files, that are like the original pf files, but now the $ have been
    replaced with the variables associated with the grid.

Notes:

    If the program finds .pf files that seems to have been created earlier, it will ask 
    you if you want to delete them
                                       
History:

    0709    ksl
        Coded and debugged
    1701    ksl
        Updated for Python3.  It should be backward compatible.  I have partially
        but not completely updated the style to the way I would write this program
        today.
