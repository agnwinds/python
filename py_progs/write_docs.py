Synopsis:

Find all of the python files in a directory and write out html
pydoc documentation of them in the current working directory


Command line usage (if any):

        write_docs.py [directory_name]

                if the directory name is missing then assume
                the routine is being run from the pydocs directory
                and the the directory to be documented is ../../py_progs

Description:

    The routine finds all of the .py files in the named directory and
    generates a shell script which runs pydocs to create html help
    files for each .py file.  Assuming the directory name is mydir
    It then creates a another html file, doc_mydir.html which simply
    contain links to all of the individual files



Primary routines:

Notes:

    If you want to get an html help for a specfic package the python
    command is simply
        pydocs package_name
    The help html files have links to the packages such as pyfits
    but these are incorrect because pydocs assumes all the help
    files are in the current working directory, which they are likely
    not.

    The does not delete help from routines that have been deleted from
    a package, which is a problem.  One could fix this, but one would
    then need to keep some kind of database so that you knew what files
    should exist.

    Note that you should watch the written output.  If it gives
    and odd looking error which writes out some of the code it
    means that one has not put

    if __name__ == "__main__":

    in front of the main routine.  If this happens you will need
    to indent all of the lines in main, and then rerun this
    script



History:

100805    ksl    Coding begun
111111    ksl    Modified so it actually used the entire name for the file.
        pydoc will then use that file to make the doucmentation
        Otherwise it searches for it in the path and that is less
        likely to be what I want.
