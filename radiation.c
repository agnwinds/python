 Synopsis:
	 radiation(p,ds) updates the radiation field parameters in the wind and reduces 
	 the weight of the photon as a result of the effect free free and photoabsorption.
	 radiation also keeps track of the number of photoionizations of h and he in the
	 cell. 
Arguments:

	PhotPtr p;	the photon
	double ds	the distance the photon has travelled in the cell

Returns:
	Always returns 0.  The pieces of the wind structure which are updated are
	j,ave_freq,ntot,  heat_photo,heat_ff,heat_h,heat_he1,heat_he2, heat_z,
	nioniz, and ioniz[].
 
Description:	 
Notes:
	
	The # of ionizations of a specific ion = (w(0)-w(s))*n_i sigma_i/ (h nu * kappa_tot).  (The # of ionizations
	is just given by the integral of n_i sigma_i w(s) / h nu ds, but if the density is assumed to
	be constant and sigma is also constant [therefy ignoring velocity shifts in a grid cell], then
	n_i sigma and h nu can be brought outside the integral.  Hence the integral is just over w(s),
	but that is just given by (w(0)-w(smax))/kappa_tot.)  The routine calculates the number of ionizations per
	unit volume.
	
	This routine is very time counsuming for our normal file which has a large number of x-sections.  The problem
	is going through all the do loops, not insofar as I can determine anything else.  Trying to reduce the calucatiions
	by using a density criterion is a amall effect.  One really needs to avoid the calculations, either by avoiding
	the do loops altogether or by reducing the number of input levels.  It's possible that if one were clever about
	the thresholds (as we are on the lines that one could figure out a wininning strategy as it is all brute force
        do loops..  

	57h -- This routine was very time consuming.  The time spent is/was well out of proportion to
	the affect free-bound processes have on the overall spectrum, and so signifincant changes have been made
	to the earlier versions of the routine.  The fundamental problem before 57h was that every time one
	entered the routine (which was every for every movement of a photon) in the code.  Basically there were
	3  changes made:
		1. During the detailed spectrum cycle, the code avoids the portions of the routine that are
	only needed during the ionization cycles.
		2. Switches have been installed tha skip the free-bound section altogether if PHOT_DEN_MIN is
	less than zero.  It is very reasonable to do this for the detailed spectrum calculation if one is
	doing a standard 
	were to skip portions of when they were not needed 

	?? Would it be more natural to include electron scattering here in Radiation as well ??
	?? Radiation needs a major overhaul.  A substantial portion of this routine is not needed in the extract 
	?? portion of the calculation.  In addition the do loops go through all of the ions checking one at a time
	?? whether they are above the frequencey threshold.  
	?? The solution I believe is to include some kind of switch that tells the routine when one is doing
	?? the ionization calculation and to skip the unnecessary sections when extract is being carried out.
	?? In addition, if there were a set of ptrs to the photionization structures that were orded by frequency,
	?? similar to the line list, one could then change to loops so that one only had to check up to the
	?? first x-section that had a threshold up to the photon frequency, and not all of the rest.
	?? At present, I have simply chopped the photoionizations being considered to include only thresholds
        ?? shortward of the Lyman limit...e.g. 1 Rydberg, but this makes it impossible to discuss the Balmer jump
History:
 	97jan	ksl	Coded as part of python effort
	98jul	ksl	Almost entirely recoded to eliminate arbitrary split between
			the several preexisting routines.
	98nov	ksl	Added back tracking of number of h and he ionizations
	99jan	ksl	Increased COLMIN from 1.e6 to 1.e10 and added checks so
			that one does not attempt to calculate photoionization
			cross-sections below threshold.  Both of these changes
			are intended to speed this routine.
        01oct   ksl     Modifications begun to incorporate Topbase photoionization
                        x-sections.
        01oct   ksl     Moved fb_cooling to balance_abso.  It's only used by
                        balance and probably should not be there either.
	02jun	ksl	Improved/fixed treatment of calculation of number of ionizations.
	04apr	ksl	SS had modified this routine to allow for macro-atoms in python_47, but his modifications
			left very little for radiation to accomplish.  I have returned to the old version of 
			routine, and moved the little bit that needed to be done in this routine for
			the macro approach to the calling routine.  Once we abandon the old approach this
			routine can be deleted.
	04aug	ksl	Fixed an error which had crept into the program between 51 and 51a that caused the
			disk models to be wrong.  The problem was that there are two places where the
			same frequency limit should have been used, but the limits had been set differently.
	04dec	ksl	54a -- Miniscule change to eliminate -03 warnings.  Also eliminate some variables
			that were not really being used.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Began modifications to allow for splitting the wind and plasma structures
	06jul	ksl	57h -- Made various changes intended to speed up this routine. These include
			skipping sections of the routine in the spectrum generation
			phase that are not used, allowing control over whether fb opacities
			are calculated at all, and using frequency ordered pointer arrays
			to shorten the loops.
	11aug	nsh	70 changes made to radiation to allow compton cooling to be computed
	11aug	nsh	70 Changed printout of spectra in selected regions so it is always
			the midpoint of the wind
	12may	nsh	72 Added induced compton
	12jun 	nsh	72 Added lines to write out photon stats to a file dirung diagnostics. This is
			to allow us to see how well spectra are being modelled by power law W and alpha

 Synopsis:
	double sigma_phot_topbase(x_ptr,freq)	calculates the
	photionization crossection due to the transition associated with
	x_ptr at frequency freq
Arguments:
     struct topbase_phot *x_ptr;
     double freq;

Returns:

Description:
	sigma_phot uses the Topbase x-sections to calculate the bound free
	(or photoionization) xsection.	The data must have been into the
	photoionization structures xphot with get_atomic_data and the
	densities of individual ions must have been calculated previously.

Notes:

History:
	01Oct	ksl	Coded as part of general move to use Topbase data
			(especially partial xsections, which did not exist 
			in the Verner et al prescriptions
	02jul	ksl	Fixed error in the way fraction being applied.
			Sigh! and then modified program to use linterp

Synopsis:

double den_config(one,nconf) returns the precalculated density
	of a particular "nlte" level.	If levels are not defined for an ion it
	assumes that all ions of are in the ground state.

Arguments:

Returns:

Description: The first case is when the density of the particular level
is in the wind array The second caseis when the density of the levels
for an ion are not tracked, and hence only the total density for the
ion is known.  In that case, we assume the ion is in it's ground state.
