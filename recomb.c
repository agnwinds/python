  Synopsis:

The routines in this file all have to do with photoionization and 
recombination rates and emissivities.  

(Note -- These descriptions need to be cleaned up and checked at some point. 
Today 06jul27 -- I just reorganized things more sensibly, but this section
should describe all of the routines generically)

Calculate the free-bound emissivity of a cell.   This is the emissivity,
eg ne * ni *enu.  It includes the electron density

  Description:
This is the version of the program that used detailed balance to
calculate the emissivity.  The specific formulation implemented
is that described most clearly in Hazy, but that comes from
Brown and Matthews 1970.

ion_choice      0- (nions-1) causes fb to return the emissivity of
		a specific ion number, i.e. 0 will be h1, 2 will be
		he1, etc.   
		>=nions returns the total emissivity
		<0  returns the emissivity of all metals, under the
		assumption that H and He comprise the first five
		ions in the input array.
fb_choice	When an ion recombines there are three possible quantities
		of interest.
			0=the emissivity/per unit frequency of the plasma
			1=the heat lost from the electrons (that is the
				fraction of the emissivity that does not
				go into the binding energy of the level
				to which the electron+ion are recombining)
			2=the emissivity in photons/unit frequency
		0 shoulc be used in calculations of the emission spectrum but
		1 and should be used in energy loss and gain  calculations), while
	        2 should be used in ion densities and levels
                                                                                                   
  Arguments:  
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
  Returns:
                                                                                                   
  Notes:
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   

For reference here is  the freebound structures that can be used for both the
specific emissivity of a free-bound transition.  But the real structue is
in python.h

	#define NTEMPS        100             // The number of temperatures which are stored in each fbstruct
	#define NFB   10              // The maximum number of frequency intervals for which the fb emission is calculated

	struct fbstruc
	{
	  double f1, f2;
	  double emiss[NIONS][NTEMPS];
	}
	freebound[NFB];

	double xnrecomb[NIONS][NTEMPS];       // There is only one set of recombination coefficients
	double fb_t[NTEMPS];

                                                                                                   
  History:
	01oct	ksl	Began work
	01nov	ksl	Adapt to include Verland cross-sections as well.
	02jun	ksl	Modified so could be used to calculate emissivities in
			photons as well as energy.
	06jul	ksl	57h-Standardized the headers and notes.  I have not
			really checked that everything is up to date, just
			put it into a more readable format.

	f1,f2		The frequency limits on the calculation 
			of the emissivity (ignored if the number 
			of recombinations is desired.
	nion		The ion for which the emissivity is returned
	fb_choice	A switch which determines exactly what is to
			be returned: 
			0- the full emissivity including
			the energy associated associated with the
			threshold
			1- the (reduced) emissivity, e.g. excluding
			the threshold energy.  This is the energy
			associated with kinetic energy los
			2- the specific recombination rate.
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
  Returns:
	The routine returns the specific emissivity, e.g. the emissivity and
	or recombination rate per electron and per ion.
                                                                                                   
  Notes:
	As written, in July02, the idea is that if the recombination coefficients
	have been calculated the program is going to return an interpolated
	coefficient, if not, it will calculate it from scratch.  (The later is 
	much slower if one has to do it a lot of times.

	???? Error -- There is definitely an error because the program does
	not support option 0, and this is needed for calculation of the
	relative numbers of photons by fb vs free free photons.  ksl 02jul

 		the entire wind cell to integ_fb 
  02jul	ksl	Added call to init_freebound so that precalculated values would
  		be used where possible.  This seemed the most conservative place
		to put these calls since total_fb is always called whenever the
		band-limited luminosities are needed.

  Notes:
	57h -- This routine was a major time sync in python57g.  Most of the problem
	was ascociated with the generation of pdfs.  So the program now has a 
	rather multilayered approach to reducing the number of pdf generation
	steps that has to be done.  For a long time, we simply stored a pdf in
 	the pdf_fb array.  For python_57h, I created a new structure, photstoremain
	which parallels plasmamain and with allows one to store photons for future
	use.  
	
	It's possible the time for this routine to take could be reduced by storing
	more than one set of extra photons for different frequncy intervals, since
	our "banding" approach causes the frequencies to shift during the photon
	generation cycle.  Alternatively, it is possible that changing the order
	of photon generation could help.  But the approach adopted eliminate
	most of the problems with the routine, and so I have not pursued that.

  History:
	98	ksl	Coded as part of python effort
	98oct	ksl	Removed upper limits on freqency to attempt to resolve problems with
			different frequency limits in total_fb and one_fb
	01oct	ksl	Completely rewritten for topbase x-sections
	06jul	ksl	57h -- Modified to speed the program up by checking whether
			there are free_bound frequencies that have been previsulsy
			calculated for this cell and this condition.  Also, added
			a section which creates and stores multiple photons for
			the same conditions.  This reduces very significantly
			the number of times one has to construct a pdf, which is

  Synopsis: init_freebound initializes the structure fb_struc as well as some
associated arrays and variables (found in python.h) that describe
recombination rates and band-limited luminosities.
                                                                                                   
  Description:

	t1, t2	The lower and upper limits for which the fb 
		information is calculated.
	f1, f2	The frequency interval in which the band-limited
		fb information is calculated.

  Notes:
	The first time the routine is called, both recombination
	rates and band-limited luminosities are calculated.  On
	subsequent calls the routine checks to see whether it has
	already calculated the band-limited freebound emissivities, 
	and if so returns without redoing the calculation.  However, 
	if a new frequency interval is provided, the new luminosities
	are added to the free-bound structure.  To force a 
	re-initialization nfb must be set to 0.

History:
        06jul   ksl     57h -- Began coding
	08may	ksl	60a -- Added code to make sure that one
			was only checking the first word in VERSION.
			Previously, there was a problem with VERSION
			having an extra space compared to the version
			that was read back.  May be just an OS X
			problem.
