/* This file contains various ways in which to calculate the
   ionization of a plasma.  The guiding difference between
   whether to put routines here or in ionization.c appears to
   be that here one takes the conditions, radiative weight as
   given and calculate the densities of each ionic species, while
   ionization.c is involved in trying to match heating and cooling.

	00Jan02	ksl	Removed some of the routines which allowed
   			special calculation of H and He 
	01dec	ksl	Major modifications to all routines.  (a) update
			calls to concentrations and nebular_concentrations
			so WindPtrs are passed.
	02jun	ksl	Modified calls yet again.  This time the goal
			is to have all the modes etc interpreted in
			nebular concentrations, so one can actually tell what 
			is happening in nebular concentrations, and to
			avoid doing any real work in nebular concentrations.

  Synopsis:   

int
nebular_concentrations (xplasama, mode)  modifies the densities of ions, levels, and
	partition functions of ions within a cell of the wind based upon the mode, 
	and other data contained within the WindPtr itself, such as t_r, t_e, w, 
	based on the "mode".  

        This version of the code is a first, quick and dirty, attempt to include the
        fraction of recombinations going into the ground state as a correction factor
        following Mazzali and Lucy (CK).  In other words, ionization equilibrium here
        is calculated from equation 11 of Mazzali & Lucy.
  
  Arguments:		
     PlasmaPtr ww;
     int mode;			// 0=saha using tr, 1=saha using te, 2= Lucy & Mazzali


  Returns:
 	nebular concentrations alters portions of the wind ptr.  Exactly how things 
	are changed depends on the mode.
 
 	nebular_concentrations returns 0 if it converged to an answer, -1 otherwise.  On an
 	abnormal return the density array and ne are left unchanged.
 	
  Description:	

	As of 01dec (python39), nebular concentrations serves as the steering routine
	for all ionization calculations.  This change was made to push down all of the
	various choices about calculation of ionization to a single routine, so that
	no longer needs to include case statements or logic for how to handle the various
	choices elsewhre.  The Lucy & Mazzali calculation is still carried out within
	nebular concentrations although that is historical at present.

	It remains true that for the Lucy and Mazalli calculation, concentrations is
	called initially, a choice which today seems bizarre...since the LM calculation
	can be carried equally well straight away.
	
	My pre-01dec notes said:

	This is a first attempt to fudge the ionization equation in the wind to account 
	for the fact that one is not sitting in a BB radiation field.  The routine assumes one
	has already put the concentrations of of the ions under LTE conditions for a temperature
	t_r into density.  It uses the same dumb procedure as for "concentrations."  

 
  Notes:
	It's probably OK but it would be worthwhile worrying whether I have introduced 
	any problems by setting the floor to any species and ne of DENSITY_MIN	

	Mode is not consistent across all of the parts of python, so don't assume that
	mode here is geo.ionization_mode...for example.


  History:
	1997	ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort. 
	97aug27	ksl	Eliminated the goto statement in the main iteration loop and
 			added numerous comments.
	97oct2	ck	Implemented Mazzali & Lucy eqn 11.
	98may	ksl	Moved ne calculation to separate subroutine
	98may	ksl	Moved actual calculation for Mazzali & Lucy to a separate routine for
 			each element
	01dec	ksl	Changed the way in which nebular concentrations was called, so that all
			the variables are taken from the windptr except for the mode. In addition
			nebular_concentrations was made the sole call from other parts of python, and
			so for example saha should never be called elsewhere.  This last step wasw
			to encapsulate the determination of abundances (given known conditions.)
	02jun	ksl	Moved Lucy-Mazzali calculation to a separate routine.  Now nebular
			concentrations is simply a driving routine
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Modified to use plasma structure.  There are no volumes involved
			so use plasma stucture in call to routines.
	080808	ksl	60b -- Removed mode 4 which attempted to carry out detailed balance
			for H and He and ussd LM for other elements.  (This was carried out
			in the routine dlucy) This is wholly replaced by the macro atom approach.

 Synopsis:   
int
concentrations (xplasma, mode)
     PlasmaPtr xplasma;
     int mode;			//   0=saha using tr, 1=saha using te
  	determines the concentrations of individual ions assuming a form of the 
	Saha equantion.  The atomic data required must have been read in with the 
	routine "get_atomic_data".  Most of the actual information to calculate
	the concentrations is already contained in ww
  
 Arguments:		

     WindPtr ww;
     int mode;			//   0=saha using tr, 1=saha using te

 Returns:
	concentrations returns 0 if it converged; -1 if it did not converge.  If it does
	not converge, both density and *ne are likely to be garbage.

	Other results...e.g. the densities.. are stored in ww.
 
 Description:	
 	
	The Saha eqn. is  (e.g. Motz, p 110, eqn 4.14

  	 N_r+1 N_e / N_r =  (2*pi*m*kT)**1.5/h**3 2 Z_r+1(T)/Z_r * exp (-X/kT)
   
	where N_r+1 is the number density of the r+1 ionization state
	and   Z_r+1 is the partition function of that state.  

	The program works by perfoming a crude iteration on ne.  It could undoubtedly 
	be improved, if one wanted better accuracy or higher speed.


 
 Notes:
	
	So that one doesn't get zero-divides in other programs, e.g. nebular_concentrations, 
	a floor is set on the density of any ion or the electron density.



 History:
 	1997      ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort.  All of the partition functions
 				have been set to 1.
 	97aug27 ksl	Eliminated the goto statement in the iteration of the Saha equation and
 				added numberous comments.
 	97aug27 ksl      Updated code to include an estimate of the partition function based on
 				the ground state multiplities.  Add an error return if the function failed
 				to return.
 	98may	ksl	Moved ne calculation to separate subroutine
 	98may	ksl	Moved saha calculation for an individual element to a separate routine
	00mar	ksl	Fixed error in initial estimate of ne so that it is correct at high temperatures
			Basically the problem was due to the fact that at high enough temperatures
			a subtraction was being performed which could lead to an initial value of
			0 for ne from which the code never recovered.  Note--I believe there still
			may be a small problem with this section of the code because it does not
			take account of the partition function in the initial estimate.  On the
			other hand the effect of this error should be minor.
	01jul	ksl	Added a real partition function to routine
	01dec	ksl	Changed variables used to call saha, and made a subroutine of nebular
			concentrations (python_39)
	02jul	ksl	Included the electron multiplicity in the SAHA constant.
      
        04Apr   SS      Added a call to macro_pops so that macro atom ionization fractions are used
                        in place of others.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Switched to plasma structue wind no volumes
	07mar	ksl	Convert warnings to errors to stop many writes

 Synopsis:   
  	fix_concentrations(xplasma,mode) sets the concentrations of individual ions
  	assuming hard coded ionization fractions that are read from a file
  
 Arguments:		


 Returns:
	
Description:	

	The first time the routine is called it reads the file specified by
	geo.con_file which populates the force_con array.

	On subsequent calls the values of one of an xplasma element are 
	modified.

	The format of the file is fairly obvious

	Element.z   Ion   ion_fraction

	6            4       1

	would set the CIV fraction to 1.  
	
	Note there is nothing forcing the totals to be anything sensible.


 	

Notes:
	To change the ions that you want to fix, simply update con_force,
	AND MAKE SURE NFORCE IS SET TO THE NUMBER OF IONS

History:
 	97sep13	ksl	Adapted from concentrations
 	98may	ksl	Moved ne calculation to separate subroutine
	01mar	ksl	Moved specification of fixed concentrations to a file
	04dec	ksl	54e -- previously a specific file fixed.dat was
			read.  With this change, the concentration file
			name is read as part of the inputs
	080802	ksl	60b -- Made fix_concentrations calls resemble
			those of other routines of the same type
