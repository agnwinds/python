  Synopsis:  

  These are routines which provide a very brief summary of 
  how the program is proceeding, mainly information about
  how many cycles have completed.  They are used for restarting
  python, primarily.

  Description:	

  Arguments:  


  Returns:

  Notes:

 

  History:
08nov	ksl	Coded as part of effort to be able to restart jobs
		on the Royal cluster

xsignal generates a single line message to a file names root.sig

where the message is determined by the format and the extra variables 
that are passed to the program.  This portion of the routine
operates in the same way that an fprintf statement operates
and was derived from the routines used for logging.

max_time is the amount of time in seconds that one wantts the program to run 
without stopping.  It can be updated at any point.

Note

check_time is the routine that halts the process if it runs too long.

The first call to the routine timer() sets the time.  It is fine to call this
directly but that is not necessary, as timeer will be called every time xsignal
is invoked.

   check_time checks whether the elapsed time is greater than the max_time
   and terminates the program if that is the case.

   If the current time is greater than the allowed time. Then the program is
   stopped, and a signal is sent to the .sig file that the program can be 
   restarted

   If the maximum time has not been set then this routine is a NOP

Note:
	Generally speaking one should send a message to xsignal before
	invoking check_time to record the status of the signal file
