 * @brief      Calculates the total luminosity of an AGN type source
 *
 * @param [in] double  r   radius of emitting object
 * @param [in] double  lum   the luminosity of the AGN (2-10keV) - used in the continuum model case 
 * @param [in] double  alpha   the spectral index of the PL source - also sometimes used for a temperature if a BB source is required
 * @param [in] double  freqmin   minimum frequency to integrate over
 * @param [in] double  freqmax   maximum frequency
 * @param [in] int  ioniz_or_final   flag to say if we are in the ionization cycles or spectral cycle
 * @param [out] double   f    the returned luminosity  
 * @return     f - the luminosity - seems to be returned as well as set implicitly.
 *
 * @details
 * This routine is used when one is working out how many photons will be made
 * from each of several sources. This computes the total luminosity of a source
 * of radius r, with spectral index alpha between band boundaries given by freqmin 
 * and freqmax
 * 
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * The 2-10keV luminosity of the PL source) is only used in the emittance_continuum
 * whwere it is used to scale the model luminosity to obtain the required value.
 * A slight inconsistency is that the bremstrahlung code uses values for T and alpha that
 * are stored in the geo structure, whilst the power law uses data supplied in the code.
