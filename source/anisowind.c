 *
 * Python supports several ways to determine a new photon
 * direction when a photon scatters in thie wind.  These
 * include 
 *
 * * SCATTER_MODE_ISOTROPIC -isotropic scattering (randvec), 
 * * SCATTER_MODE_ANISOTROPIC - anisotropic scattering 
 * (randwind) and 
 * * SCATTER_MODE_THERMAL - thermally-broadened anisotropic scattering 
 * (randwind_thermal_trapping).

/* 
randwind (xyz, lmn, north) is a routine to calculate a new direction
for the photon for specific presciptions regarding the anisotropy
of scattering.  To use a different prescription the only thing that
should have to be modified is vrandwind.

Here 

 xyz is the position of the photon in cartesion coordinates
 north is the 
 the direction of maxium velocity gradient in 
	cylindrical coordinates

and 
 lmn is the new direction of the photon in cartesian coordinates 
	which is returned is returned.

02feb	ksl	Modified jumps in randwind so evenly spaced.
02feb	ksl	Mad major modifications to the way in which
		the direction was projected back to the 
		cartesian frame, and also to the generation
		of the photon direction in the azimuthal
		direction.  The routine was seriously 
		screwed up.
02may	ksl	Made modifications to generalize anisowind
		and to incorporate changes associated
		with creating a new (constant source function)
		based scattering function.  The routines are
		now much more integrated in the sense that
		only one routine vrandwind needs to be
		changed to incorporate a new scattering
		model (as long as the model is axisymmetric)
		about some direction..presumable the direction
		of tau_min.  N.B. There are some dependences
		on the order in which the routines are called,
		i.e. you must call randwind before vrandwind,
		since randwind initializes some variables that
		one needs in vrandwind.  
02may	ksl	Changed calls to avoid having to pass tau_min
		to the routine.  Hopefully this will help
		eliminate questions of what has been calculated
		when, or at least isolate it to the routines
		in this file.
02may	ksl	Added a check to prevent tau from going too low
		when calculating pdf_rand.  ?? It might be more
		computationally efficient to switch to isotropic
		in this case ??
15aug	ksl	Minor changes for multiple 
17jun	nsh - changed references from PDFs to CDFs - because
		this is what they actually are!

/** @name      randwind
 * @brief      calculate a new direction
 * for the photon which is being scattered in the wind
 * in the SCATTER_MODE_ANISOTROPIC scattering mode.
 *
 * @param [in] PhotPtr  p   The photon (at the position it is scattering, and the resonance causing the scatter indicated)
 * @param [out] double  lmn[3]   The new photon direction
 * @param [in] double  north[3]   the direction of maximum velocity gradient in the wind cell where the photon is located
 * @return     Normally returns 0, -1 if nres for the photon is not positive (which would indicate this was not a resonance scatter)
 *
 * @details
 * This routine is called whenever one wants to generate a new
 * direction in  the SCATTER_MODE_ANISOTROPIC scattering mode.  
 *
 * 
 * Given the photon position and the resonance, 
 * the routine * first calcuates the optical
 * depth in the direction of the maximum dv_ds for that
 * cell.  
 *
 * The routine then calls, make_cdf_randwind to create a
 * comulative distribution function for scattering of as
 * a function of the angle from the direction of minimum
 * optical depth.
 *
 * Using this cdf, it randomly selects a direction for 
 * the photon.
 *
 * These calculations are all carried out as if the 
 * photon were in the x-z plane, because that is where
 * the velocity gradient is defined.  As a result
 * one then has to trasform the new photon direction
 * back to the location of the photon 
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * To use a different prescription the only thing that
 * should have to be modified is vrandwind.
 *
 * It might have been more logical to have transformed
 * the direction of the maximum velcocity gradient 
 * to the position of the photon.
