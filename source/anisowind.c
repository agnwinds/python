 * @brief  Routines to implement anisotropic scattering in
 * the wind
 *
 *
 * Python supports two ways to determine a new photon
 * direction when a photon scatters in thie wind.  These
 * include 
 *
 * * SCATTER_MODE_ISOTROPIC -isotropic scattering (randvec),
 * * SCATTER_MODE_THERMAL - thermally-broadened anisotropic scattering
 * (randwind_thermal_trapping).

/**
 * @brief the routine which chooses
 *   a new anisotropic direction in geo.scatter_mode = SCATTER_MODE_THERMAL
 *
 * @param [in,out] PhotPtr  p   The photon being scattered
 * @param [out] int *  nnscat   The number of times the photon
 * scattered internally before escaping the local scattering region
 *
 * @return     0 for success. Also modifies the photon ptr p
 *   to reflect new direction (p->lmn), and nnscat, which
 *   should be copied to the photon structure after calling
 *   this routine.
 *
 * @details
 * This routine uses a rejection method to choose a direction
 * so that the probability distribution of directions generated
 * reflects the probability of escape along each direction in accordance
 * with the sobolev optical depth.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * The resonance that caused the scatter must be stored in the
 * photon bundle.
 *
 * The name of the routine is something of a misnomer. Pure
 * sobolev optical depths are used.  The temperature in the
 * cell does not come into the calculation.
 *
 * 1904 - ksl - In certain situations, see issue #505, the photon can
 * get trapped in the while loop.  To prevent his from hanging
 * the routine bails after NSCAT_MAX trips through the while loop
 * and chooses the direction with the lowest tau it has found. 
 * From a physics perspective, this is not an ideal treatment of
 * the problem ans so if this occurs a lot of times, something
 * better needs to be done.
