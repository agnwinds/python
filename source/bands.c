 * @brief  Setup the frequency bands used for stratified sampling and
 * for recording spectra in wind cells.
 *
 * The subroutines here deal with two related issues, how to choose how
 * many photons or photon bundles to create in various wavelength ranges,
 * and how to record the spectrum that pass through individual cells.
 *
 * Photons, or photon bundles, in Python are created with certain
 * frequency and carry a certain amount of energy.  Without
 * any kind of stratified sampling all of the photons would be created
 * with the same energy content and frequencies which sample the spectrum
 * in equal energy intervals.  The sum of energies of all of the
 * photons bundles originating in, for example, a stellar photosphere
 * would equal that of the luminosity of the star.
 *
 * Normally, however, Python uses a form of stratified sampling to assure
 * we have photons in various energy bands.  This is important, especially
 * for calculating ionization rates since one needs enough photons
 * above ionization edges to estimate the rate accurately.  In banding,
 * one chooses a number of photons in a given frequency range and changes
 * the energy of the photon bundle so that the proper normalization is
 * obtained.  
 *
 * Once one has decided how many photons in what wave bands to generate
 * one also needs to capture a crude spectrum in each cell of the grid
 * at least for many of the ionization modes we use.  The resolution
 * needs to be good enough to allow for various important ionization 
 * edges, but not so fine that one cannot characterize the slope of the
 * spectrum in each interval.  
 *
 * The routines init_bands in this file sets up the bands to for creating
 * photons based on various user inputs; it then calls freqs_init that 
 * sets up the frequency boundaries for recording the spectra.
 *
 * The two tasks are only loosely related, and in fact while there
 * is a lot of flexibility in for stratified sampling, the spectra
 * in the cells are recorded largely on the basis of the system type.

/** 
 * @brief      This is the routine that initializes the frequency bands    
 * used to ensure that photons are created in sufficient numbers across
 * a large range of frequency during ionization cycles.
 *
 * Python uses a form of stratified sampling in an attempt to assure
 * that there are photon bundles at (high, generally) frequencies
 * in sufficient numbers for accurate ionization equilibria to be
 * calculated.
 * 
 * This is the routine that initializes the bands, and the fraction of photons
 * to be generated in each band.    There are
 * a number of possiblilities for setting up the bands
 *
 * @param [in] int  imode   A switch used for determining how the bands are to be populated
 * @param [out] struct xbands *  band   The structure that is populated with the band information 
 * @return     The routine itself simply returns 0 on success
 *
 * The outputs are passed to other routines through the pointer
 * to xbands.  
 *
 * @details
 *
 * The currently allow modes are
 * *0	Use temperature to define a single band
 * *1	Use f1 and f2 to define a single band
 * *2	Use t,f1 and f2, and hardwired bands to define multiple bands which have
 *    been tuned to be relevant to CVs and other systems where a hot disk
 *    (T_eff of about 100,000 K is assumed)
 * *3 Bands tuned for yso
 * *4 Query the user to specify an arbitrary set of bands
 * *5 Bands set up by nsh to test cloudy
 * *6 Hardwired very wide bands for testing
 * *7 Bands hardwired for AGN paper1 by nsh
 * *8  Define bands in logarithmic intervals
 *
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * Various choices for banding have been developed over time, often in
 * the process of working on different types of simulations.  In general,
 * it is up to the user (by pure thought or by experimentation) to find
 * a set of frequency ranges and photon fractions in each band so that a 
 * calculation can be carried out efficiently.  Choosing the wrong banding
 * will make the program slow to converge/noisy because one does not have
 * enough photons in the necessary intervals, and in extreme situations 
 * to get the ionization structure wrong.  Evidently, option 4 allows 
 * the user the most flexibility.
 *
 * This routine also calls the routine freqs_init which initializes the
 * boundaries for recording coarse versions of the spectra in each
 * cell. This process is also sometimes referred to (confusingly) as
 * banding.  At present this is more or less hardwired.

 *
 * @details
 * 
 * In order to approximate the radiation field in each plasma cell, one
 * needs to record a coarse spectrum.  There is no point in creaating 
 * a detailed spectrum since this will (usually) not be justified by the
 * photon statistics and in any event wouuld require to much memory. Memory
 * restrictions also mean we cannot simple record the effects of individual
 * photons.  
 *
 * So that one can sensibly record a coarse spectum, one needs to define
 * the frequency boundaries for the course spectra.  That is the purpose
 * of this routine.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * At present everything is hardwired.  In the case of SPECTYPE_CL_TAB,
 * a special broken power law used for comparisons, a different set
 * of bands are used.
 *
 * freqmin and freqmax are used in order to limit the total range of
 * the spectral bands.
 *
 * Although some the description of this routine refer to banding
 * this routine does have anything to do with the stratified sampling
 * used to create photons.
