 Synopsis:
	
double planck(t,freqmin,freqmax)	returns the frequency of a "pseudo-randomly generated photon. 
double t,freqmin,freqmax;		temperature of BB, and frequency limits
  
 					The frequency is pseudo random in the following limited sense.  
					The photons are returned are weighted so that the energy distribution 
 					of a planck function is approximately reproduced. Within an energy 
 					bin the photon frequency is uniform.  

double
emittance_bb (freqmin, freqmax, t)

double freqmin, freqmax, t;
					Calculate the emittance of a bb between freqmin and freqmax

double integ_planck_d(alphamin,alphamax)
double alphamin,alphamax;

					returns the integral of the dimensionless blackbody function
					between alphamin and alphamax.  

					Because we cannot afford to keep reintegrating this integral, 
					the following procedure is used.  The first time the function is
					called the integ_planck[] is filled.  integ_plank[n]  contains the 
					integral of the dimensionless planck function from  ALPHAMIN to 
					ALPHAMAX.  Therefore if one wants to obtain the integral of the 
					dimensionless bb function, one simply interpolates this array


init_integ_planck_d() 			performs the integration of the dimensionless bb function
					in order to fill the arry integ_planck.  This routine needs only to be
					 called onetime. The actuall integration is done with the numerical 
					 recipes routine "qromb" .

check_fmax(fmin,fmax,temp)		This is a little helper routine written by NSH in August 2012. We
					were having lots of problems with trying to integrate cross sections
					x a plack function at temperatures where there is no flux at fmax. This
					little routine just checks if fmax is going to be more than 100xt/(h/k)
					which will return tiny numbers for planck, and make qromb return
					nonsense.

Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	
		The way this works currently is a little obscure.  The primary routines are emittance_bb or planck.  
		They call the other routines

		The first call to either of these routines (surely emittance_bb) results in a call to integ_planck_d, 
		which in turn calls integ_planck_init.  This initialization routine in turn populates the 
		array integ_planck , which contains the integral of the bb function in an array.

		bb_emittance continues to access the array integ_plank through integ_planck_d every 
		future time is is called.

		planck does the same thing albeit more indirectly. It sets up a cdf each time new frequency 
		limits are placed on it.  planck therefore really uses the
		cdf.

		
Notes:
		It seems possible that some of these routines could be combined in a clever way
		

History:
 	97	ksl	The various portions of this file were written in 1997 as part of the python effort
 	98mar	ksl	Combined the routines here from bb_gen.c and planck.c to reduce the total number of
 			files.
 	98mar23	ksl	planck(t,freqmin,freqmax) modified to use new pdf routines
 	98apr25	ksl	integ_planck_d modified to fix an error when the ranges of alphamin and alphamax
 			were out of bounds
	98jul27	ksl	planck moddified to force denser selection of gridpoints for small and high freq relative
			to kt
	01dec	ksl	Increased number of points at high end as part of exercise to force selection
			of some high frequency photons (python_40)
	04mar	ksl	Modified to provide a better treatment when the frequency range is
			above or below the frequency limits of the cdf that was calculated 
			initially.
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Relegated writing the pdf file to a case where you were debugging
	06aug	kls	57h -- Recommented and reorganized the file, so that could complete a partial
			fix to a problem Sturat had identified.  The partial fix was generating 
			photons outsde the min and maximum frequency
	12aug	nsh	73e -- check_fmax written to check qromb calls will work properly.
	12nov	ksl	74a_ksl -- Revised  rand_exp, which is used to allow us to reasonalbly 
			approximate photons in the high alpha limit.  Eliminated some old notes about
			this routine that seemed no longer very relevant.\
	13mar	jm	74b5_JM -- fixed bug JM130303 in init_integ_planck. This bug was causing 
			the emittance in the range wavemin-wavemax in the spectral cycles to be calculated 
			wrongly. Was noticed when testing YSO models.

 Synopsis: planck returns the frequency of a "pseudo-randomly generated photon.  The
   frequency is pseudo random in the following limited sense.  The photons are returned
   are weighted so that the energy distribution of a planck function is approximately
   reproduced. Within an energy bin the photon frequency is uniform.  
	

Arguments:		

     temperature, 
     freqmin, freqmax  - frequency interval 

Returns:

     The frequency of a photon  drawn randomly from a BB function with 
     temperature T
 
Description:	

	The first time one enters the program, a cdf for a diminensionaless
	BB function is created.  On subseqent entries, when the temperature
	or frequency limits are changed, we use standard routines to limit
	what portion of the dimensionless cdf to use.

	Because of of the rapid fall off of the proabability density function
	at very low and high frequency, special routines exist to deal with
	photons in these regions of the spectrum.

Notes:

	12nov - ksl - I have deleted some of the old notes associated with
	this routine.  When this routine was written, computers are a lot
	slower than they are today, and I was quite concerned about the
	possibility that this routine would take a lot of computer time.
	Computers are much faster today, and this routine does not 
	consitute a significant fraction of the time of the entire 
	program.  It is possible, that a more accurate routine could
	be created more simply today.

History:
	06aug	ksl	57h --Recommented, as moved to fix a problem
			that was returning photons that were occassionally outside
			of the frequency limits.  The problem had been introduced
			to handle the YSO case, where Stuart had found the uniform
			distribution used to interpolate between frequency points
			annoyoing
	06aug	ksl	Eliminated call to Stuart's attempt to better handle
			the low frequency limit, in favor of a new routine
			that I hope fixes the problem of the frequency
			limits.  
	06sep	ksl	Hopefully correct the remaining problems with this,
			but there is a significant issue with all of our pdfs after 
			we have created pdf arrays, we simply create a uniform 
			distribution within an interval.
	06sep	ksl	57i -- Have simplfied this to elimiante for now any lo or hi
			frequency special cases
	12nov	ksl	Removed some of the old Notes assocaited with this routine.
			See version earlier than 74 for these old notes.
	17jul	nsh - changed references to PDFs to CDFs
