 * @brief  Routines concerning the generation of photons from blackbodies
 *
 * ### Notes ##
 *
 * The two main routines are emittance_bb or planck.  The rest of the routines
 * are helper routines that should not normally be called directly.
 *
 * The first call to either of these routines (surely emittance_bb) results in a call to integ_planck_d,
 * which in turn calls integ_planck_init.  This initialization routine in turn populates the
 * array integ_planck , which contains the integral of the bb function in an array.
 * bb_emittance continues to access the array integ_plank through integ_planck_d every
 * future time is is called.

 * planck does the same thing albeit more indirectly. It sets up a cdf each time new frequency
 * limits are placed on it.  planck therefore really uses the
 * cdf.
 *
 * Both emittence_bb and planck accept inputs in physical units, frequencies and temperatures. Internally
 * howeve the routines convert physical to dimensionless units.

 *
 * The first time one enters the program, a cdf for a diminensionless
 * BB function is createda.  The cdf is created for values between ALPHAMIN and
 * ALPHAMAX where ALPHA=h nu/kT. The number of points in the cdf is determined by NMAX
 *
 * On subseqent entries, when the temperature
 * or frequency limits are changed, we use standard routines to limit
 * what portion of the dimensionless cdf to use.
 *
 * If the freuency range and temperature for a photon falls outside of ALPHAMIN
 * and ALPHAMAX special routines are used to sample the distribution there.
 * so that the spectrum falls off as a power law at low frequencies and an
 * exponential at high frequencies.
