  Synopsis: bilin calculates the fractional position in the coordinate
 	grid of a 2d vector x.  

  Description:	


  The input 2d input vectors are assumed to have the relationship
  shown in real space, that is x00 and x01 are more or less along
  the z axis, while x00 and x10 are more or less along the +x acis

    x01 ....... x11
    .            .
    .            .
    x00 ....... x10



  Arguments:  
     double x[] 			The position within the cell
     					for which one desires
					the fractional position 
					in the grid

     double x00[], x01[], x10[], x11[]  The corners of the cell


  Returns:
     double *f, *g;                     The fractional position
     					along the "x" and "z" direction of 
					the cell respectively
    The routine itself returns 0 if the postion is inside the cell, and 
    -1 otherwise.

  Notes:

  Basically
        X= (1-g) [ (1-f) X00 + f X10 ] * g [ (1-f)*X01+ f* X11 ]

	where the capitalized values of X,etc denote vectors, and
	f and g are the fractional weithings.  

	X = (1-g) A + g B 

	It is easy to solve for g in terms of f

	g = (X-A)/(B-A)

	where A = [ (1-f) X00 + f X10 ] and B =  [ (1-f)*X01+ f* X11 ]

	But this gives you two expressions for g depending on whether you
	consider the 0 or 1 component of the vector, and therefore you
	can solve for f.  More specifically, 

	g= [(X-XOO) + f (XOO-X10)] / [(X01-X10)+f (X11+X00-X01-X10)]

	or 

	g = (Q + f R) / (S+f T) 

	where Q, R, S, and T are defined from the equation above.

	So expanding in terms of the component veciots what we have is

	(Q[0]+f R[0]) (S[2]+f T[2]) = (Q[2]+f R[2]) (S[0]+f T[0])

	which can now be put in the form of a xquadratic

	a f**2 + b f +c = 0

	where 

	a = r[0]*t[2] - r[2]*t[0]
	b=  r[0]*s[2] + q[0]*t[2] - ( r[2]*s[0] + q[2]*t[0] )
	c = q[0]*s[2] - q[2]*s[0]


	A problem with this approach is that does not work in the case 
	where the coordinates are the x axis positions of X01 and X01
	are the same and the X10 and X11 are the same.  This is because
	the denominator becomes 0 in the equation for g.  This 
	particular case is important because it is the case we are
	trying to solve for.

	In this case we need to solve for f by itself. Similarly there 
	is a degnereate case when
              (x00[2] == x10[2] && x01[2] == x11[2])

   This solves a simple xquadratic (or if a is zero linear equation).  The return is set up
   to make it easy to identify the smallest positive root if one exists.  The routine returns
   a negative number if both roots are negative or imaginary. 
   More specifically 
	 -1 -> both roots are imaginary
         -2 -> both roots are negative or 0
          0 -> the first root is the smallest positive  root 
          1 -> the second root is the smallest positive root
History
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Heretofore roots of 0 were on no interest, but now that 
			xquadratic is called by bilin, we would like to know about values

			check both roots in this case, I added a little code to make
			sure root was defined in all cases.
