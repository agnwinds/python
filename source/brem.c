 * @brief  Functions to allow a Bremsstrahlung type input spectrum
 *
 * This was added as part of the Rad-hydro effort and is intended
 * to allow a spectrum to match the assumed spectrum in the Blondin
 * heating and cooling rates. Note that this spectrum is very
 * similar in some ways to a blackbody spectrum - essentially
 * a power law turning into a high frequency exponential drop off
 * and so there is a great deal of similarity with routines in
 * bb.c There is scope here for simplification.
