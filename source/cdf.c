 *
 * @brief  Routines to create a cumulatimve distribution (CDF) from a function or array, and then to
 * sample that cdf in a fleximble manner.
 *
 * @details
 *
 * CDFs can be generated either from a function using cdf_gen_from_func or from an array using
 * cdf gen_from_array.  The function or the array that is input are used as the proability densities
 * for the cdfs.  The cdfs are stored in a Cdf structure (See python.h)
 *
 * The procedure is either
 * to call cdf_gen_from_func if you have a function whose probability distribution you
 * want (as might be the case if you were generating bremsstrahlung photons and you knew
 * the formula)  or cdf_gen_from_array (as might be the case if you were trying to
 * generate Monte Carlo spectra from precalculated Kurucz models).
 *
 * Once the cdfs are generated one can sample the full distribution distritution function
 * with cdf_get_rand, or one can sample a part of the distribution by setting the
 * part that one wants with cdf_limit and then sampling the distribution with cdf_get_rand_limit
 *
 * There are a number of helper functions that are internal to the generation of the cdfs,
 * and verification that the cdfs are readonable.
 *
 * ###Notes###
 *
 * In generating the CDFs, one must be careful of places where the pdf is discontinuous, or more
 * generally changing in a way that will not be well represented via linear interpolations.  When
 * generating a CDF from a function it is possible to specify positions where one wishes to have
 * points, e.g on either side of a discontinuity.  When generating a CDF from a function, the
 * discontinuities should be well sampled in the array that is provided.
 *
 * @bug For reasons, which are currently unclear there are differences in the number of points
 * maintained in the cdfs for different generation methods.

 *
 * We have defined the cdf in such a way that one can generate a random number 0 and
 * 1, find the place in the y array that corresponds to this and map back onto the
 * x values (which is what is returned. We now want to limit the range of the returned
 * x values, but we need to know in terms of the original array where these values
 * are and the generate a random number between some minimum (>0) and maximum (<1) whichi
 * will allow one to find the x that corresponds. The point of this routine is to
 * find that minimum and maximum value. Having done this one can call cdf_get_rand_limit
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * Sometimes it is expensive computationally to recalculate the distribution function
 * every time you change the limits.   An example of this is the distribution function
 * for a bb where the distribution function is quite smooth (and can be represented in a
 * dimensionless manner) but calculating the function and the distribution function
 * can be expensive.  This routine together with cdf_gen_rand_limit allow one to sample a part of a
 * cdf.  Note that cdf_gen-from_func or cdf_gen_from_array should have been
 * called previously!
 *
 * xmin and xmax will cause cdf[].limit1 and cdf[].limit2 to be set
 * in such a way that when you call pdf_get_rand_limit the distribution
 * will be sampled only between xmin and xmax.
 *
 * If these routine is called improperly, e.g if
 * xmin and xmax lie outside of the original value of xmin
 * and xmax then the distribution will not extend this far,
 * and the progrem will exit.
