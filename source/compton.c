 * This routine works out the opacity of a cell to Compton (Thompson) scattering.
 * It is designed to give the correct *heating* effect when high frequency photons

 * not only the cross section is freqneucy dependant, but so is the mean energy
 * transfer.- just using the Klein-Nishina cross section will give the wrong results in terms
 * of actual heating effect of these interactions.

 * @details
 * This routine computes the temperature dependant Compton cooling rate in ergs/s.
 * It is mainly called as part of the search for a new temperature balancing heating

 *
 *
 * ### Notes ##
 * Compton cooling or 'inverse Compton scattering' is the process of energy transfer
 * from hot electrons to 'cool' photons, that is when 4kT > hnu.
 * For each interaction, the fractional energy loss from the electrons is given
 * by \frac{}\delta e}{e} = 4k_BT/mc^2.
 * Where we have a model for the mean intensity of radiation in a cell, we are
 * able to compute the cooling rate by doing an integration over the mean intensity
 * multiplied by the frequency dependant cooling cross section.
 * which looks like C=4k_BT/mc^2 * 4/pi \int{\sigma_T * beta * J_{\nu} d\nu}.
 * Beta is the effective cooling cross section from fits in Hazy 3.
 * If we are in the low frequency limit, we dont need to integrate, because the
 * cooling cross section is not frequency depedant in the Thompson limit so we
 * can just multiply by the band limited mean intensity.
 * Simiularly, if we dont have a model - we just do the best we can which is
 * to multiply by the total integrated mean indensity times the Thormpson
 * cross section.

 * EVerything is calculated in the rest frame of the electron.
 * In this frame, the photon energy change is E/E'=1+(hnu/mc^2)(1+cos\theta)
 * where \theta is the angle through which the photon is deflected.
 * This is a maximum for \theta=180 - E/E'=1+2hnumc^2
 * and minimum for \theta=0 - E/E'=1
 * We compute everything by first drawing a random cross section that our photon packet will see.
 * This cross section represents an energy change and hence a direction. The
 * distribnution of angles is taken care of by using a differential cross section
 * vs energy change function. So we work out what energy change and hence direction
 * is implied by our random cross section.
