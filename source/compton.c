  Synopsis:  These are the routines to handle compton scattering.

  Description:	There are two routines in here:
		kappa_compton (xplasma,freq) this calculates the opacity in the cell xplasma due to compton cooling

  Arguments: 		


  Returns:

  Notes:

  History:
2011	nsh	Coded as part of the effort to include compton scattering in August 2011 at Southampton.

  Synopsis:  kappa_compton computes the opacity in the cell due to compton heating.

  Description:	

  Arguments:   xplasma - pointer to the current plasma cell
		freq - the frequency of the current photon packet being tracked

  Returns:   kappa - the compton opacity for the cell.

  Notes:   This implements the equation kappa=(sigmaT*ne*freq)/(me*c^2)
            Initally it is called by radiation
