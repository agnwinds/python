feb 2013 - nsh - approximate KN cross section replaced by correct value
jan 2017 - nsh - and back to approximate cross section - we believe that this is required since not
	only is the cross section changed by the incoming photon energy (KN) but also the mean energy transfer
	is changed - the correct cross section to use is that reported in Hazy 3.
