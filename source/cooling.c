Synopsis:  xtotal_emission (one, f1, f2) Calculate the total cooling of a single cell 
			due to free free - line and recombination processes.

Arguments:		


Returns:
 
Description:	
	

Notes:
	xtotal_emission gives the total enery loss due to photons.  It does
	not include other coooling sources, e. g. adiabatic expansion.

	It returns the total cooling, but also stores the luminosity due
	to various types of emssion, e.g ff and  lines into the
	Plasms cells. The fb cooling calculated here is *not* equal to
	the fb lumniosity and so this value is stored in cool_rr.

	Comment: The call to this routine was changed when PlasmaPtrs
	were introduced, but it appears that the various routines 
	that were called were not changed.

History:
	2017 - copied from total_emission and modified for use in calculatingh
			cooling alone.

Synopsis:  
	adiabatic_cooling (one, t) determines the amount of 
	adiabatic cooling in a cell, in units of luminosity.

Arguments:		
	WindPtr one;	pointer to wind cell
	double t;		electron temperature

Returns:
 
Description:	
   Adiabatic cooling is clearly the amount of PdV work done by
   a fluid element, per unit time dt. Thus it is equal to P dV/dt.  
   The only real question is whether dV/dt is given by the volume * div v.
   div v here is the divergence of the velocity field.
	
Notes:
  JM 1401 -- I've rederived the expression for dv/dT. It follows
        directly from the continuity equation and is indeed equal 
        to volume * div_v. 

        Note also that this function should only be called
        if geo.adiabatic == 1, in which case it populates
        xplasma->cool_adiabatic. This is used in heating and cooling
        balance. We also use it as a potential destruction choice for 
        kpkts in which case the kpkt is thrown away by setting its istat 
        to P_ADIABATIC.


History:
	04nov	ksl	Stuart had switched adiabatic cooling off
  			by commenting out the entire program.  I have
  			reinstated the calculation, but created a new
  			variable geo.adiabatic to determine whether this
  			routine is called in python.  At present, even
  			if the routine is called it has no effect.  The
  			or more properly, one issue is how to meld adiabatic 
  			cooling with the macro atom approach.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Adapted to include plasma structure
	11aug	ksl	70 - Adiabatic cooling returns the cooling but
			does not store it.
