 * @return The adiabiatic cooling (or heating) of a cell
 *
 * @details
 * Adiabatic cooling is the amount of PdV work done by
 * a fluid element, per unit time dt. Thus it is equal to P dV/dt.
 * dV/dt is given by * the volume * div v.  As is evident from
 * this what we call adiabatic cooling can heat the wind if div
 * v is negative.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * In calculating the adiabatic cooling we include the pressure
 * from all particles.  Adiabatic coolling due to the radiation
 * pressure is not considered.
 *
 * The routine does not populate xplasma->cool_adiabatic.
 *
 * Note also that this function should only be called
 * if geo.adiabatic == 1, in which case it populates
 * xplasma->cool_adiabatic. This is used in heating and cooling
 * balance. We also use it as a potential destruction choice for
 * kpkts in which case the kpkt is thrown away by setting its istat
 * to P_ADIABATIC.
 *
 * @bug The statements here about not calling this routine are
 * odd.  There is no reason that the routine cannot be called
 * any time since it does not populate cool_adiabatic.  And
 * what really shold happen if we do not want to use cool_adiabatic
 * is that we should check when we want to calculate the total cooling
 * that it is not done.
