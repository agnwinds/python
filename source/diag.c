 Synopsis:
	 open_diagfile sets up diagnostic files for use in python when the extra.diagnostics flag is 

Arguments:

	PhotPtr p;	the photon
	double ds	the distance the photon has travelled in the cell

Returns:
	Always returns 0.  .
 
Description:	 
Notes:
	

History:

	12jun 	nsh	72 Added lines to set up a file for outputting photons in given cells. The cells are read in from a file called diag_cells.dat. The existance of this file defined wether the diagnostic takes place.
	13jul	jm	changed print statements to logs and made more descriptive
	14oct   jm  changed to reflect move to 'advanced mode', see #111 and #120

Synopsis:
	get_extra_diagnostics reads in extra diagnostics if 
	the user has asked for them. It uses rd_int() in rdpar.c
	to get the modes, which should always be one or zero.

Arguments:	
    none	

Returns:
    modifies the modes structure to turn on whichever modes
    are asked for.
