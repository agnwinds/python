 *
 * @brief
 * This routine consolidates an approach to providing extra diagnostics
 * for debugging python. It also
 * contains initialization routines
 * that control which diagnosics are tracked.
 *
 * The first few functions are associated with gather information about what
 * one wants to track
 *
 * The basic idea for the extra diagnositics routines are as follows:
 *
 * There is one file to which all of the diagnostics are written.
 * Which diagnositica are written depends on how varaious of the modes
 * variables are set.
 *
 * All of the various diagnostic routines should be line oriented and begin
 * with a unique identifier to allow easy parsing of the outputs.
 *
 *
 * To add a new diagnostic one should
 *
 *  * (0) check that one of the existing diagnostics is insuffient for your needs
 *  * (1) add a routine here that writes to the diagnostic file.
 *  * (2) add a rdchoice statement in get_extra_diagnostics that allows you to track
 *  this diagnositic
 *  * (3) Assure that your new routine has the appropriate doxygen description,
 *  * (4) Add a yaml file for the new rdpar statement), and
 *  * (5) call the routine with the approriate condidtions from wherever you wish.
 *
 * As written, you must put your routine here.  This is done on purpose
 * so that we will not proliferate extra diagnostics around the various
 * subroutines.
 *
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * The unified approach makes most sense when one wants similar information
 * spread out over several routines.  There will be places where one
 * wishes to print out detailed information within a certain routine.
 * A current example is print_dvds_info, which is totally contained within
 * gradv.c
 *
 * This approached was adopted, based onthe discussion isssue #338
 * A detailed look at the subroutines indicates that this, especially the
 * part having to do with writing to a single diagnostic file is a work
 * in progress.
 *
 * Right now there are a number of very similar routines, some of
 * which might be combined.
 *
 * Note that as most of these routines are currently writen, one should
 * check whether the that appropriate flag is set, before calling 
 * the routine.  Otherwise, one may write to a file that has not been
 * opened.

 * In advanced mode, this routine provides ways to change
 * several somewhat unrelated parameters in the routines
 *
 * The parameters are
 * * the fractional distance a photons may travel
 * * the lowest ion allowed to contribute to photabosrption
 * * whether photoabsorption is considered in the final spectrum
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * @bug It is not obvious that much recent thought has been
 * given to the choices that are here.  The fractional distance
 * that a photon travel is intended to make sure the velocity
 * along the line of sight can be approximated linearly.  If
 * a photon travels too far in an azimuthal direction the sense
 * of the velocity can change and this prevensts this
 *
 * The lowest ion density contributing to photoionization is used
 * to determine what ions one has to calculate the photoionzation
 * xsection for.  The lower this density; the more that have to be
 * calculated, and as a result the slower the program.
 *
 * Keeping photoionizaion during final spectrum allows one to
 * check the contribution of photoabsorption.
