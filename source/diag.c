 Synopsis:
	 open_diagfile sets up diagnostic files for use in python when the extra.diagnostics flag is 
Arguments:

	PhotPtr p;	the photon
	double ds	the distance the photon has travelled in the cell

Returns:
	Always returns 0.  .
 
Description:	 
Notes:
	

History:

	12jun 	nsh	72 Added lines to set up a file for outputting photons in given cells. The cells are read in from a file called diag_cells.dat. The existance of this file defined wether the diagnostic takes place.
	13jul	jm	changed print statements to logs and made more descriptive
