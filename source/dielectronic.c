 * @brief      calculates the total luminosity from DR.

 * @param [in] WindPtr  one   Pointer to the wind cell currently under analysis
 * @param [in] double  t_e   The temperature of the cell - this is from the plasma structure
 * @return     the total luminosity of this cell due to dielectronic recombinaions - currently set to zero
 *
 * @details
 * This routine is a dummy routine at the moment - it mirrors the other
 * routines which compute the luminosity due to various cooling routines, but
 * currently always returns zero, because
 * as of the current time we do not know how to work out the luminosity
 * from dielectronic recombination. We know the rate, which is used in ionization
 * calculations but the energy released by each recombination is complex and
 * depends on what happens to the excited ion.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * This is issue #186
