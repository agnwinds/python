 * Usually, if the photon misses the disk going in the positive

 * The z-height of a vertically extended disk is defined by

 * The need to allow for negative distances arises
 * because several of the parameterization for the wind (SV, KWD) depend
 * on the distance between the current position and footpoint
 * along a streamline (and these streamlines are defined in the
 * outgoing direction).
 *
 * If the position of the photon is on the disk the routine returns
 * 0 and it is up to the calling routine to interpret what to do
 * in this situation.  For very large distances one may need to worry

 *  Note that the disk height is defined even outside or the region
