/* vdisk calculate the speed and velocity v at which material given

Description:

   The routine determines the speed by interpolating on stored
   values in the structure disk
  
   It then takes the xproduct of a unit vector pointing north and
   the position, to determine the direction of motion at this point
   in the disk
  
   Finally it rescales this to get the actual velocity.
  
   is travelling in the
   disk by interpolating on the velocities that are contained 

Notes"

	The routine projects the input variable x on to the xy plane
	before it calculates velocities.  

History:

	08mar	ksl	Added explanation of what the routine does. The
			routine was not changed.
