 * @brief      Calculate the temperature of the disk at a normalised distance x
 *
 * @param [in] double  x   distance from center of disk in units of r/rstar
 * @return     The temperature
 *
 * The routine returns the effective temperature for the disk as a distance
 * which is measured in terms of the ratio of the actual distance to the inner
 * edge of the disk (rmin).
 *
 * Modifications to a simple steady state disk are possible, depending
 * on the variable geo.disk_tprofile:
 *
 *  - DISK_TPROFILE_READIN  the returned temperature is interpolated from values that
 *    been read in
 *
 *  In addition for a standard profile, this is where disk heading can optionally
 *  be taken into account
 *
 *
 * ###Notes###
 *
 * A reference for the standard steady state disk is Wade, 1984 MNRAS 208, 381
 *
 * An analytic profile used for Sim+05 to model certain YSO winds was removed in
 * 1907

 * along a streamline (and these streamlines are defined in the
 * outgoing direction).
 *
 * If the position of the photon is on the disk the routine returns
 * 0 and it is up to the calling routine to interpret what to do
 * in this situation.  For very large distances one may need to worry

   * Now we need to find exactly where we have hit the disk.  This is
   * not trivial.  Basically we need to bracket the possibilities
   * 
   * At this point we know the photon is on a path that passes through (or
   * passed through the disk) and we must locate it. There are two
   * possibilities.  It hit the disk edge, or it hit the face of the
   * disk.  Most of the time it will hit the disk face so we will
   * calculate this first, and then check if s is less than s_diskplanerad.
   * 
   * To setup rtsafe, we have to find distances which bracket what we
   * want.  smax should be no more than the distance to the disk plane
   * (assuming we have a photon headed toward the plane)
   * 
   * Note that the next little section is intended to select between the
   * top and bottom face of the disk
