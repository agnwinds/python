 *
 * @param [in] double  x   distance from center of disk in units of the minimum
 * radius of the disk

 * @return     The temperature
 *
 * The routine returns the effective temperature for the disk as a distance
 * which is measured in terms of the ratio of the actual distance to the inner
 * edge of the disk (rmin).
 *
 * Modifications to a simple steady state disk are possible, depending
 * on the variable geo.disk_tprofile:
 *
 *  - DISK_TPROFILE_READIN  the returned temperature is interpolated from values that
 *    been read in
 *
 *  In addition for a standard profile, this is where disk heading can optionally
 *  be taken into account
 *
 *
 * ###Notes###
 *
 * For disks that start at a radius that is larger than r_star, the temperature
 * is based on the minimum radius.
 *
 * A reference for the standard steady state disk is Wade, 1984 MNRAS 208, 381
 *
 * An analytic profile used for Sim+05 to model certain YSO winds was removed in
 * 1907

 *
 *
 * Usually, ds_to_disk returns the distance along the line of

 * If the photon misses the disk going in the positive

 * positive direction.
 *
 * The routine allows both for a flat disk, and a vertically
 * extended disk
 *
 *
 *
 * ###Notes###
 *
 * The z-height of a vertically extended disk is defined by
 * zdisk.  The outside edge of the disk is assumed to be
 * a cylinder at geo.disk_rad_max.  
 *
 * The need to allow for negative distances arises
 * because several of the parameterization for the wind (SV, KWD) depend
 * on the distance between the current position and footpoint
 * along a streamline (and these streamlines are defined in the
 * outgoing direction).
 *
 * If the position of the photon is on the disk the routine returns
 * 0 and it is up to the calling routine to interpret what to do
 * in this situation.  For very large distances one may need to worry
 * about round off errors if moving a photon to the disk position.
 *
 * In Dec. 21, the portion of the routine that handles veritically
 * extended disks was revised (#924), Conceptually, the approach
 * that is used divides space into three separate regions, (1)
 * inside the disk, (2) outside the disk, but inside the pillbox
 * that bounds the disk, and (3) outside the pill box.   If a
 * photon is inside the disk, we generally assume that one wants
 * the position where the photon entered the disk; otherwise we
 * generally want to find the the forward direction of the photon,
 * the exception being when wants to find velocities in the SV and
 * KWD models.
