Synopsis:  total_emission (one, f1, f2) Calculate the total emission of a single cell 

Arguments:		


Returns:
 
Description:	
	

Notes:
	Total emission gives the total enery loss due to photons.  It does
	not include other coooling sources, e. g. adiabatic expansion.

	It returns the total luminosity, but also stores the luminosity due
	to various types of emssion, e.g ff, fb, lines, compton into the
	Plasms cells

	Comment: The call to this routine was changed when PlasmaPtrs
	were introduced, but it appears that the various routines 
	that were called were not changed.

History:
	97	ksl	Coded
	98oct	ksl     Removed temperature limits within total_emission in
			and attempt to concentrate the frequency limits elsewhere.
	01nov	ksl	Removed superflous code
	01nov	ksl	Changed call so t_e passed through wind structure.  Other
			routines should be changed ALSO, BUT NOT NOW
	04Mar   SS      Modified to divert if Macro Atoms being used.
	04Apr   SS      Modified to include a collisional cooling term
	                - this is getting very messy and confusing - I think
                        I should probably put together a completely separte
			set of routines for doing the heating and cooling in the
			macro atom cases. (SS) since this is now not really a
			total emission but total cooling.
	05may	ksl	57+ -- To use plasma structure for most things.  If vol
			is added to plasma then one can change the call

Synopsis: photo_gen_wind(p,w,weight,freqmin,freqmax,istart) generates 
	photons within the wind and stores them in the photon array

Arguments:		
	WindPtr w;
	PhotPtr p;
	double weight;				weight of each photon
	double freqmin,freqmax;          frequency interval within which photons are created
	int istart;					photon number in which first photon is placed

Returns:
	Normally returns the number of photons created.  So photons will exist from p[istart]
	to p[istart+return value].
	
	If photo_gen_wind tries to create more photons than exist in the photon structure the
	program will stop (rather than continue incorrectly or start blasting away memory.)
 
Description:	
	Calls photo_gen_wind_one for each cell.

Notes:

History:
 	98feb	ksl	Coding began
 	98may16	ksl	Added line to keep track of the number of recombinations
 	98dec21	ksl	Added the variable inwind and clarified loop which finds a position in

	99oct19	ksl	Fixed error in loop above.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Began to modify to use plasma, but this is a
			stopgap for now since should not need to be addressing

			grid was tramsmitted.
