Synopsis:  total_emission (one, f1, f2) Calculate the total emission of a single cell 

Arguments:		


Returns:
 
Description:	
	

Notes:
	Total emission gives the total enery loss due to photons.  It does
	not include other coooling sources, e. g. adiabatic expansion.

	It returns the total luminosity, but also stores the luminosity due
	to various types of emssion, e.g ff, fb, lines, compton into the
	Plasms cells

	Comment: The call to this routine was changed when PlasmaPtrs
	were introduced, but it appears that the various routines 
	that were called were not changed.

History:
	97	ksl	Coded
	98oct	ksl     Removed temperature limits within total_emission in
			and attempt to concentrate the frequency limits elsewhere.
	01nov	ksl	Removed superflous code
	01nov	ksl	Changed call so t_e passed through wind structure.  Other
			routines should be changed ALSO, BUT NOT NOW
	04Mar   SS      Modified to divert if Macro Atoms being used.
	04Apr   SS      Modified to include a collisional cooling term
	                - this is getting very messy and confusing - I think
                        I should probably put together a completely separte
			set of routines for doing the heating and cooling in the
			macro atom cases. (SS) since this is now not really a
			total emission but total cooling.
	05may	ksl	57+ -- To use plasma structure for most things.  If vol
			is added to plasma then one can change the call

	double freqmin,freqmax;          frequency interval within which photons are created

Returns:
	Normally returns the number of photons created.  So photons will exist from p[istart]

	If photo_gen_wind tries to create more photons than exist in the photon structure the
