 * @brief      The main routine for building
 * 	detailed spectra in the normal (extract) mode.
 *
 * @param [in] WindPtr  w   The entire wind
 * @param [in] PhotPtr  p   The photon to extract
 * @param [in] int  itype   An integer representing the type of photon
 * for the purpose of being extracted.
 * @return     Always returns 0
 *
 * @details
 * extract is called when a photon begins its flight and every time that photon
 * scatters, unless the user has exercised the "live or die" option, in
 * which case it is not called.
 *
 * extract carries out all of the preparatory steps to create the
 * photon to be extracted, and then calls a routine extract_one
 * to reduce the weight of the photon as it passes out of the system
 *
 * itype takes on the following values:
 * * PTYPE_STAR->the photon came for the star
 * * PTYPE_BL->the photon came from the boundary layer
 * * PTYPE_DISK->the photon being redirected arose in the disk,
 * * PTYPE_WIND->the photon being redirected arose in the wind,
 *
 * extract uses the types to prepare the photon for extraction, including
 * doppler shifting the photon if is of PTYPE_WIND or PTYPE_DISK.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * The logic behind the weighting of the (disk/star) photons is described 
 * in Christian Knigge's thesis in
 * section 2.3.4.  According to equation 2.19
 * 	Pc/Pw=12 cos(theta)*(1+b cos(theta)/(3+2b) where b=1.5 corresponds to the
 * Eddington approximation.
 *
 * Usually, Python constructs a spectrum of all photons, but there are
 * advanced options which allone to restrict the spectrum created to
 * those produced with a certain number of scatters or from photons
 * that arise from the above or below the disk.  extract enforces
 * those choices before calling extract_one.
 * The parameters for this option all come in through
 * python.h, and are contained in the spectrum structure.
 *
 * The basic choices, some of which can be used in tandom are as follows:
 *
 * *	If s[n].nscat>999; then one obtains the entire spectrum
 * *	if s[n].nscat is a positive number, then the spectrum is composed just
 * 		of photons with that number of scatters
 * *	if s[n].nscat is a negative number, then the spectrum contains all photons
 * 		with >=  the absolute value of s[n].nscat
 * * 	s[n].top_bot=0 -> accept all photons
 * * 	s[n].top_bot    >0  -> accept photons last above the disk
 * * 	s[n].top_bot    <0  -> accept photons below the disk
 * *    One can also select photons that are to be extracted from a particular
 * spherical region.
