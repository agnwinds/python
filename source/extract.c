 Synopsis:

int extract(w,p,itype) is the supervisory routine which helps normally
	builds detailed spectra as the photons are transit the wind.

Arguments:		
	PhotPtr p;	The initial photon
	WindPtr w;
	int itype	PTYPE_STAR->the photon came for the star 
			PTYPE_BL->the photon came from the boundary layer
			PTYPE_DISK->the photon being redirected arose in the disk,
			PTYPE_WIND->the photon being redirected arose in the wind,
Returns:
 
 
Description:	

extract is called when a photon begins it's flight and every time that photon
scatters, unless the user has exercised the "live or die" option, in
which case it is not called.  extract calls extract_one for each spectrum
it wants to build, where the actual incrementing of the spectrum is done.

An option allows one to construct spectra which have undergone a certain
number of scatters.  The parameters for this option all come in through
python.h.  
	If s[n].nscat>999; then one obtains the entire spectrum
	if s[n].nscat is a positive number, then the spectrum is composed just 
		of photons with that number of scatters
	if s[n].nscat is a negative number, then the spectrum contains all photons
		with >=  the absolute value of s[n].nscat
Another option allows one to construct spectra from photons which have
	scattered above or below the plane of the disk.  As for the number of
	scatters this option comes through python.h, in this case from s[n].top_bot
	s[n].top_bot=0 -> accept all photons
	                  >0  -> accept photons last above the disk
	                  <0  -> accept photons below the disk
Notes:

History:
 	97march ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort.  
 	97aug28	ksl	Added the option which allows one to construct spectra with a
			specific number of scatters.
	97sep1	ksl	Added the option which allows one to construct spectra which
			originate from a specific position above or below the disk
	02jan	ksl	Fixed problems with itypes. (Photons which were wind photons
			for the purpose of extract were not being properly labelled
			as such, and this meant they were not doppler shifted properly.
			This produced photons that were further from resonance in the
			local frame and made the wind more transmissive, especially
			in the blue wing of the line.  It suggests
			that a lot of the absorption in extract is fairly local and
			that the blue wing structure could be fairly sensitive to how
			the doppler shift is carried out.)

 Synopsis:

extract_one(w,pp,itype,nspec)

Arguments:		
	PhotPtr p;
	WindPtr w;
	int itype		0->the photon came from the star 
				1->the photon came from the boundary layer
				2->the photon being redirected arose in the disk,
				3->the photon being redirected arose in the wind,
	int nspec		the spectrum which will be incremented
Returns:
 
 	The photon status after translation
 
Description:	

extract_one is analogous to the detailed portion of transphot except here the
basic point is to calculate the optical depth through the plasma in a certain
direction, and to increment the appropriate spectrum.  There are a few differences
though because here we also check whether the photon hits the secondary star.
		
Notes:

The logic behind the weighting of the photons is described in Christian Knigge's thesis in
section 2.3.4.  According to equation 2.19
	Pc/Pw=12 cos(theta)*(1+b cos(theta)/(3+2b) where b=1.5 corresponds to the
Eddington approximation.

In python, and in extract and transphot in particular, tau generally refers to the tau associated
with scattering processes, and the weight contains the effect of dimunition of the energy of
the photon bundle due to pure absorption processes.  So, in extract, we add pp->w * exp(-tau)
to the spectrum.

History:
 	97march ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort.  
 	97july	ksl	Included the possibility that the photon was absorbed by the secondary.
 	97sep28	ksl	Modified weightings of extracted photons to be those in Knigge's thesis for
			Eddington approximation
	02jan2	ksl	Adapted extract to use photon types
