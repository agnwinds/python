 *
 * @brief  The routines here provide a way to read grids of models and
 *   then to interpolate between them
 *
 * @details
 *    	There are two main routines
 *
 *    		get_models (modellist, npars, spectype)
 *
 *    	which reads a list of models
 *
 *    	and
 *
 *    		model (spectype, par)
 *
 *    	which given a set of parameters will interpolate between modles
 *    	given the set of models one wants to interpolate betwee, which
 *    	is determined by spectype, and the set of parameters (par) that
 *    	define the models
 *
 *  ### Notes ###
 *
 *  A detailed understanding of these routines requires an understandig
 *  of the associated data structures which are in models.h
 *
 *  The individual models are contained in a stucture called Models
 *
 *  A summary of a set of models is contained in ModSum, along with
 *  a interpolated model generated by the routine model
 *
 *  get_models is called as part of the initialization process.
 *
 *  model is called as one generates photons for specific raddiation
 *  sources, e.g the disk.  It stores a spectrum/cdf of that spectrum
 *  in ModSum, which can be used to genreate photons for that spectrum.

 * @brief     This routine reads in a set of models for use in generation of spectra,

 * @return     *spectype is also returned
 *
 *
 * @details
 *
 * These are a generic set of routines to read a grid or grids
 * 	of models, e.g. a set of Kurucz stellar atmospheres which can
 * 	used to simulate a disk, given a run of temperature and gravity
 *
 * 	The grid can be any reasonable number of dimension
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * Basically, the way this works is as followsL
 *
 * modellist is a file that cantains a list of models, and the parameters that
 * are associated with each model. (There can be mulitple parameters associated
 * with each file. Typically these are temperature, and gravity, but these routines
 * are generic, and so one could image that the the spectra are organized quite differently
 *
 * Each model, that is read in contains a list of wavelengths and a flux, that should
 * be proportional to flambda.
 *
 * There are some assumptions that are made in terms of the order in the modellist file.
 * Specifically"
 *
 *
 * 	For 1d models we assume the models are read in increasing order of
 * 	the parameter of interest.
 *
 * 	2 or more parameter models can be read in any order.  Bilinear interpolation
 * 	is done for the 2 parameter models (as long as the grid is fully filled).
 *
 *
 * 	To deal with cases in which the grid is not fully filled, we follow
 * 	the same approach as for get_hub, i.e. for parameters t and g (i.e.
 * 	the first parameter being t, and the second g., we first search the grid
 * 	for all models with t just below (above) the desired value.  We then
 * 	interpolate on g for the model just below, and on g for the model just
 * 	above, and finally interpolate between these two.
 * 	The algorithm for interpolating between models
 *
 *
 * 	Note that each time a new set of models is read in, the spectype is
 * 	incremented.

 * @brief      interpolates between spectra in a grid  placing the results in
 *   	comp[spectype].xmod
 *
 * @param [in] int  spectype   A number which refers to a specific collecton of models, which were read in
 * @param [in] double  par[]   An array that contains the parameters for the models we want to interpoalted, e.g [T, grav]
 * @return     Returns nwaves in the the spectrum if a new spectrum was calculated
 * 	0 if it was the old spectrum.
 *
 * @details
 * This is an intepolation routine.  Having previously read in a set of models which are associated
 * with a set of parameter, e.g T and g, we want the spectrum at some t and g, which is not necessaily
 * in the grid.   This routien does the interpolation and stores the result  in comp[spectype].mod
 *
 * The routine is generic as long as the requested parameters are within the grid of models,
 * but the routine makes the assumption that the first parameter is a temperature if the
 * value of the first parameter outside the range of that parameter.
 *
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * If the parameters for the interpolated routine are within the grid of models, and the grid
 * is fully filled, then a straighfoward interpolation is carried out.
 *
 * If models are missing from the grid or if the requested model has parameters which are
 * outside the grid, an "interpolated" model is still returned but assumptions are made
 * which are intended to provide a reasonable solution for the case, where the first parameter is
 * a temperature, and the second parameter is a gravity.
 *
 * Specfically, for a missing model, the first thing that happens is that the routine
 * first ignores the missing model treating each of the others as if bi-linear interpolation was being used, and
 * then renormalizing to make sure the weights of the models that one does have
 * sum to 1.  The solution is "practical" because it always gives a result, and
 * because it gives the an appropriate answer when the grid is filled.  It is also
 * easily extensible to more than two dimensions.  But it should be noted, the
 * approach is also dangerous.
 *
 * Lastly, if the first parameter is out of range, it assumes that the first parameter was a
 * temperature, and it modifies the spectrum by the ratio of a BB speccturm for the desired
 * spectrum to the temperature of the max/min temperature in the grid.  So for example, suppose the
 * models which were read in were for Kuruce models, which run out a temperature of about 50,000k
 * and you wnat the spectrum of a star which is 100,000K. Then the routine will deliver a spectrum
 * which has line features of a 50,000K star, but an overall specturm which has the shape of a 100,000 K
 * BB. This is not a good situation for this extreme case, but may be reasonable if the temperature
 * differences are less extreme.
