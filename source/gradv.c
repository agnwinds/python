 * the value of where in grid if the photon outside the wind grid.
 *
 * @details
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * For spherical coordinates the routine calculates the gradient
 * on the fly, that is moves the photon a bit and calculates dvds
 *
 * For 2d systems, the velocity gradient is calculated using
 * the velocity gradient tensors, which contain the velocity
 * gradient in the xz plane.
 *
 * It's not clear how much faster the method used for 2d systems
 * actually is, and one might want to consider the on-the-
 * fly appoach for all systems.

 * @brief      Calculate the direction averaged (and maximum)

 *
 * @return     Always returns 0
 *
 * @details
 * The routine cycles through all of the cells in the wind, and calculates
 * the aveage value of dv_ds at the center of the wind cell by randomly
 * generating directions and then calculating dv_ds in these directions
 *
 * It not only finds the average value, it also keeps track of the maximum
 * value of dvds and its direction
 *
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * The routine is called during the intialization process and fills
 * the following elements of wmain
 *
 *  * dvds_ave - the average dvds
 *  * dvds_max - the maximum value of dvds
 *  * lmn - the direction of the maximum value
 *
 * There is an advanced mode which prints this information to
 * file.
