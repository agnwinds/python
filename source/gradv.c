 * @brief      find the gradient velocity vector v, dv_ds for a photon
 * at a certain position travelling in a certain direction in the cmf
 * frame.
 *
 * @param [in] PhotPtr  p   A photon
 * @return     dvds    on successful completion
 * the value of where in grid if the photon outside the wind grid.
 *
 * @details
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * For spherical coordinates the routine calculates the gradient
 * on the fly, that is moves the photon a bit and calculates dvds
 *
 * For 2d systems, the velocity gradient is calculated using
 * the velocity gradient tensors, which contain the velocity
 * gradient in the xz plane.
 *
 * It's not clear how much faster the method used for 2d systems
 * actually is, and one might want to consider the on-the-
 * fly appoach for all systems.
 *
 * Note that as calculated here dvds can be negative, although
 * in many cases what one wants is the absolute value of dvds.
 * But this has to be calculated at the spot where dvds is used,
 * since oftend dvds is calculated at two positions and interperlated.
 * So it would be a mistake to calculate the absolute value here.
