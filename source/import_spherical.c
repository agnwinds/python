 * General purpose routines for reading in an arbitray wind model
 * in spherical coordinates
 *
 * The basic data we need to read in are

 * i r v_r rho (and optionally T)

 * We assume that all of the variables are centered, that is
 * we are not assuming that we are giving rho at the center of
 * a cell, but that r and v_r are at the edges of a cell.
 * This is someghing that would presumable be easy to change
