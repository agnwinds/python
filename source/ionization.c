 Arguments:

Returns:
 
Description:	
	The intent is that the routine ion_abundances is the steering routine for
	all calculations of the abundances
	
Notes:

History:
	98jul	ksl	Incorporated Christians mods with my comments 
	98nov	ksl	Created the steering routine ion_abundances
	00jan	ksl	Homogenized calls so that ionization_mod_on_the_spot
			and ionization_mod_on_the_spot_exact do not call the
			entire wind structure.  NOTE THAT THESE LAST ROUTINES
			HAVE NOT BEEN SERIOUSLY RECHECKED, SINCE THEY ARE NOT
			MUCH USED.
	00jan	ksl	Moved ionization_mod_on_the_spot and ionization_mod_on_the_spot_exact
			to "Legacy code" Legacy1.c
	01oct	ksl	Add calls to levels for calculation of level populations.  The
			calls are currently hardwired.
	08aug	ksl	60b	Evidently ksl modified the calls to ion_abundances
				previously, but leaving w as the variable was
				confusing.  Fixed this
	080808	ksl	62  - Removed option 4 for a partial detailed balance
			which seems totally obsolete at this point as
			we have not followed this up.  This was part of
			the cleanup of the ionizaton balance routines
			Also removed option 5, as this was not supported
			later in the program
	11nov	ksl	71 - Moved the so-called Sim power law approximation
			to its own routine to restore this routine to its intent 
			to be a steering routine and not something with a lot
			of code particular to one calculation
    12feb   nsh	71c - added options for mode 6 and 7, the two new ioinzation
			codes that compute saha abundances for pairs of ions, based on a
			good temperature for that pair, then corrects.

   Synopsis

   calc_te determines and returns the electron temperature in the wind such that the energy emitted
   by the wind is equal to energy emitted (asssuming it is in the interval bracketed by
   tmin and tmax.)

   Argumnets

   xplasma  a pointer to a single PlasmaPtr (often a dummy)
   tmin     the minimum allowed temperature
   tmax     the mqximimu allowed temperature

   Description:

   Notes:

   calc_te does not modify any abundances.  It simply takes the current value of the heating in the
   cell and attempts to find the value of the electron temperature which will result in cooling which
   matches the heating.

   This approach is not entirely self consistent because if te is actually different then the
   abundances will be different and the heating will change as well.

   This routine is a kluge because it does not really deal with what happens if the cooling curve 
   has maxima and minima.

   xxxplasma is just a way to tranmit information to zero_emit

   History:

   98dec    ksl Updated calls so that tmin and tmax were communicated externally,
			    rather than hardwired
   01dec	ksl	Reversed 98dec decision as a result of massive changes for python38
   01dec	ksl	Assured that ww->t_e is updated here
   01dec	ksl	Added capability to modify the desired goal of calc_te from the full
			    heating to something intermediate between the current value and the
			    ultimate goal
   01dec	ksl	Rewrote to assure that boundaries will be bracketed properly and if
			not calc_te will handle
   04June   SS  Modified so that changes in the heating rate due to changes in the
                temperature are included for macro atoms.
