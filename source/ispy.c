 Synopsis:

 int ispy(p,n)  collects more detailed spectral information 
	about certain hardwired cells

Arguments:		

	PhotPtr	p	A photon
	int	n	The current cell number

Returns:
 
 
Description:	

This routine identifies photons as they enter a certain cell (or cells) and writes information
about these photons to a file.
		
Notes:

History:
 	98nov	ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort to try to understand more
			about spectra in individual cells 
	99oct	ksl	Modified to give error message and quit if ispy file is not open.
