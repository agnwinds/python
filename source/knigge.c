 Synopsis:
	double kn_velocity(x,v) calculates the v in cartesion coordinates
	of a Knigge wind from a position x in cartesian coordinates.  
Arguments:		
	double x[]		the postion where for the which one desires the velocity
Returns:
	double v[]		the calculated velocity
	
	The amplitude of the velocity is returned 
	
Description:	

	This implements equations 17 & 18 of KWD95.  To get the constant
	velocity law set kn_alpha to 0.  

	58 -- If v_inf<0, then an SV law is used for the velocity along
	the streamline.	
		
Notes:

At the inner edge of the accretion disk the temperature of the disk
goes to zero, and so in principle the thermal velocity goes to zero.
The kfudge below keeps this from happening. What did Christian actually
do here?? 

04mar	ksl	The way in which the wind velocity is made to fill
		space, particular the space inside the wind cone,
		is not obvious.  The way in which this is done at
		present causes the div v calulation to be negative
		inside the windcone.  I have suppressed this after
		the first error in wind_div_v, but this could be
		a mistake.
History:
	01mar	ksl	Began coding
	02jan	ksl	Removed the implicit assumption that we always
			wanted the velocity "above" the disk plane.
	04aug	ksl	Modified to account for a disk with vertical
			extent, and to return the .
	05jul	ksl	Corrected error in the direction of ptest
	06oct	ksl	58 -- provided a very simple way to use a 
			SV velocity law (that is a law in which
			the scale height is always the place where
			the velocity is half the peak velocity) in
			what otherwise looks like s KWD model.  The
			SV law is used whenever v_infinity is less 
			than 0. Note that vzero is not changed from
			the KWD prescription.
