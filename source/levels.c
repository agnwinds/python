/** 
 * @brief      Calculates the fractional occupation numbers of
 * 	the various  of atomic configurations assuming LTE or various
 * 	alternatives to LTE
 *
 * @param [in] PlasmaPtr  xplasma   A single element of the Plasma structure
 * @param [in] int  mode  An integer which determines the way in which the partition funciton will be calculated 
 * @return     Always returns 0
 *
 * @details
 * 	The possibilites are:
 *
 * * NEBULARMODE_TR 0        LTE using t_r
 * * NEBULARMODE_TE 1        LTE using t_e
 * * NEBULARMODE_ML93 2      ML93 using a nebular approximation correction to LTE
 * * NEBULARMODE_NLTE_SIM 3  // Non_LTE with SS modification (Probably could be removed)
 * * NEBULARMODE_LTE_GROUND 4        // A test mode which forces all levels to the GS (Probably could be removed)
 *
 * levels populates the levden array in the Plasma pointer.  It
 * is called from the routine partition
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * @bug  Some rethinking of the whole level density approach needs to be done.  It's not
 * clear how these functions are being used and what difference if any that they make.
