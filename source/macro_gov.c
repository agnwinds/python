/**
 * @brief macro_gov is a routine that governs the excitation and de-excitation of macro-atoms, kpkts and simple-atoms.

 * @param [in,out]  PhotPtr  p   the packet at the point of activation
 * @param [in,out]  int *  nres   the process which activates the Macro Atom
 * @param [in]      int  matom_or_kpkt   initially excite a matom (MATOM) or create a kpkt (KPKT)
 * @param [in,out]     int *  which_out   set to 1 if return is via macro atom and 2 if via kpkt
 * @return 0        Will return an r-packet after (possibly) several calls to matom and kpkt
 *
 * @details macro_gov sits at a higher level in the code than either matom or kpkt and governs the passage
 * of packets between these routines. At the moment, since matom and kpkt
 * call each other it can all get rather confusing and loads of nested subroutine calls ensue.
 * macro_gov removes this by calling matom and kpkt which on return tell  to either return
 * an r-packet to resonate or make another call to either kpkt or matom as appropriate.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * Stuart wrote this to be as general as possible so that if we want to improve the treatment of simple
 * ions it should not need to be re-written.
 *
 * During the spectrum calculation the emission of r-packets within the spectral region of interest
 * is done using emissivities obtained during the ionization cycles. Therefore whenever an r-packet
 * is converted into a k-packet or an excited macro atom that ends the need to follow the packet any
 * further. To deal with this, this routine sets the weights of such packets to zero. Upon return to
 * trans_phot these packets will then be thrown away.
