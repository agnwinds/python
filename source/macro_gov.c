                                    Imperial College London
Synopsis:

       macro_gov is a new routine that will sit at a higher level in the code than either matom or kpkt
       and will govern the passage of packets between these routines. At the moment, since matom and kpkt 
       call each other it call all get rather confusing and loads of nested subroutine calls ensue. 
       macro_gov removes this by calling matom and kpkt which on return tell macro_gov to either return
       an r-packet to resonate or make another call to either kpkt or matom as appropriate.



Arguments:   
       WindPtr w                   the ptr to the structure defining the wind
       PhotPtr p                   the packet at the point of activation
       int nres                    the process which activates the Macro Atom
       int matom_or_kpkt           to tell us if we should initially excite a
                                   Macro Atom or create a k-packet. For Macro Atom
                                   it is set to 1 for a k-packet it is set to 2.
       int which_out               set to 1 if return is via macro atom and 2 if via kpkt

           

Returns:   Will return an r-packet after (possibly) several calls to matom and kpkt

       int nres                    the process by which re-emission occurs
       PhotPtr p                   the packet following re-emission



Description:


Notes:   I've written this to be as general as possible so that if we want to improve the treatment of simple
         ions it should not need to be re-written.

         During the spectrum calculation the emission of r-packets within the spectral region of interest
         is done using emissivities obtained during the ionization cycles. Therefore whenever an r-packet
         is converted into a k-packet or an excited macro atom that ends the need to follow the packet any
         further. To deal with this, this routine sets the weights of such packets to zero. Upon return to 
         trans_phot these packets will then be thrown away.

         
History:
          SS   June 04 - coding began
          SS   June 04 - modified to kill photons that interact with macro atoms or
                         become k-packets during the specrum calculation part of the code.
          SS   June 04 - returns 1 if last interaction was with full macro atom. 0 otherwise.
          SS   Sep  04 - added return of "which_out"
	  ksl	0803	Added lines which modify p->origin to reflect the fact
	  		that a photn has been processed by an interaction with a
			macro atom.  Basically, what I have done is simply to 
			add 10 to the origin.  This was done to account for the fact
			that its hard to constrain the frequence range of a photon
			processed by a macro atom

Synopsis:

       macro_pops uses the Monte Carlo estimators to compute a set
       of level populations for levels of macro atoms.


Arguments: one -> pointer to the wind 
           xne -> current value for electron density in this shell

Returns:   Should compute the fractional level populations for 
          macro atoms and store them in "levden" array. The ion fractions
          are also computed and stored in w[n].density[nion]


Description:


Notes:  
         This routine uses a matrix inversion method to get the level populations.
         For now the matrix solver used is the LU decomposition method provided
         by the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL, which is free). This requires the
         include files that I've added to the top of this file and access to the
         GSL "library" file (I've added the library into the Makefile too). I found
         GSL to be very easy to install but if there are problems in the future we
         may need to switch to another matrix solver. (SS, Apr 04)
         

History:
          Apr 04  SS   Coding began.
          May 04  SS   Checking/testing began. Corrected some problems with the
                       array indexing in the last part of the calculation.
          June04  SS   Adding collisional ionization/recombination rate.
	  Aug 05  SS   Modified to include fast collisional transition between
	               ground states and levels that should be metastable
                       - some treatment of metastables is needed for 
                       doing CNO macro atoms.
