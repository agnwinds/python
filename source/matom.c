Synopsis:
	Matom is the core of the implementation of Leon Lucy's Macro Atom
	approach to dealing with radiation-matter interactions. It is called whenever
	a photon packet activates a macro atom. As input it takes the process by
	which activation occurred (identified by the label "nres") which allow it 
	to deduce the level that has been excited. It then calculates all the 
	Macro Atom jumping/deactivaion probabilities following Lucy and so deduces
	the process by which deactivation occurs. At output "nres" identifies this 
	process and the packet information has been updates. 

Arguments:

       WindPtr w                   the ptr to the structure defining the wind
       PhotPtr p                   the packet at the point of activation
       int nres                    the process which activates the Macro Atom
  
Returns:
       int nres                    the process by which deactivation occurs
       PhotPtr p                   the packet following deactivation
       int escape                  to tell us whether the de-activation of the
                                   macro atom is via an r-packet (escape = 1) or
                                   a k-packet (escape = 0)

Description:


Notes: 

ksl-- There is a lot of arithmetic required to keep track of indices.  I would
be inclined to figure out a way to avoid this.  One possibility would be to record the
go_to level in an array when one is calculating the emission probabilities. This would
make it easier to add new processes, I suspect. 

It would be possible to convert the for loop to a while statement.  This would avoid the
break statement in the middle.  

History:
          Feb 04  SS   Coding began.
          Mar 04  SS   Minor changes made (based on comments from ksl)
	04apr	ksl	A. Eliminated some unnecessary if statements.  These are indicated
			by the words extra.  Stuart should remove the lines assuming he
			agrees.
			B. Changed the logic of the major do loop so that the break is moved
			higher in the do loop.  Stuart, the intent is to make the
			code more readable, and to reduce the level of nesting. 
			C. Corrected an errror that on upward bb transitions seemed to leave
			the macro-atom in the same state as previously.
			D. Shamelessly modified some of the comments to make it more
			straightforward for me to understand.
			E. m = m + 1 --> m++ in several places
			F. Modified selections to allow simple lines to be read in but
			not to affect matom.  nlines_macro is the number on macro-lines
			read in and these are the first elements in the line structure
			G. Modified the way matom determines that a transition is a photo
			ionization transition bo be consitent with change made in
			resonate.
          Apr 04   SS   Modifications to include collisional jumps/deactivation included.
          May 04   SS   Bug corrected for identification of line (nres is the place of the
                        line in the ORDERED list, not the input list).
          Jun 04   SS   Modified to carry the "escape" variable to identify de-activation
                        via r-packets and k-packets - avoids the need to call kpkt from
                        within this routine
          Jun 04   SS   Adding collisional ionization as an upwards jump possibility. No collisional
                        recombination for the moment.
          Jun 04   SS   Now putting in collisional recombination too.
          July04   SS   Modifying so that this routine does not call alpha_sp but rather uses 
                        pre-computed (stored values) for the spontaneous recombination coefficient.
                        This is an effort to speed up the code.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Adapted for use with plsama structure.  Changed call to
			eliminate passing entire w array
	06jun	ksl	57g -- Split macro variables into a separate structure. The structue
			which is createdin gridwind, is only created if there are macroatoms.
	06jul	ksl	57h -- In the process of speeding up the program in the simple 
			non-macro atom case, I tried to make sure that matom and the 
			derivative routiens were not called at all.  Note that at present
			the macroatom case is quite slow, due to what is happening in
			matom.  I am suspicious that it could be speeded up a lot.
        07jul     SS    Experimenting with retaining jumping/emission probabilities to save time.

Description:


Notes: 


History:
          Mar 04  SS   Coding began.
          Apr 04  SS   Various improvements including the addition of ff and collisions.
          May 04  SS   Minor changes made to collisional cooling rates (bug fixed)
                       and fb cooling for simple continua.
          May 04  SS   Modified to work for case with all "simple" ions.
          May 04  SS   Modified to use "scattering probability" formalism for 
                       simple ion cooling rates.
          Jun 04  SS   Modified to include the "escape" variable to identify excitation of
                       macro atoms. This removes the need to call matom from within this routine.
          Jun 04  SS   Modified to include collisional ionization as a cooling term.
          July04  SS   Modified to use recomb_sp(_e) rather than alpha_sp(_e) to speed up.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Modified to use new plasma array.  Eliminated passing
			entire w array
	131030	JM 		-- Added adiabatic cooling as possible kpkt destruction choice

Synopsis:
       fake_matom_bb is the macro atom routine that deals with line events involving
       simple ions (i.e. ions for which a full macro atom treatment is not employed.
       When this routine is called a simple line has absorbed a packet. This routine 
       creates a fake two-level macro atom and determines whether the packet energy
       is simply re-emitted in the line or is thermalised. If it is thermalised it
       turns into a k-packet and the appropriate routine is called. 


Arguments:

       WindPtr w                   the ptr to the structure defining the wind
       PhotPtr p                   the packet at the point of activation
       int nres                    the process which activates the Macro Atom

Returns:
       int nres                    the process by which deactivation occurs
       PhotPtr p                   the packet following deactivation
       int escape                  identifies whether the macro atom deactivated via an
                                   r-packet (escape = 1) or a k-packet (escape = 0). If
                                   a k-packet then the call to this routine should be

Synopsis:
       fake_matom_bf is the macro atom routine that deals with photoionisation 
       events involving simple ions (i.e. ions for which a full macro atom treatment 
       is not employed).
       When this routine is called a photoionisation has absorbed a packet. 
       The idea of this routine is to deal with the subsequenct
       by creating a fake two-level atom. 
       However, in the absense of collisional recombination (or something
       similar) there's only one thing that can happen - radiative 
       recombination. Therefore there's no need to do anything here unless
       collisional recombination is to be introduced at some point in the
       future.
       All this routine does for now is choose a new frequency for the 
       emitted r-packet.


Arguments:

       WindPtr w                   the ptr to the structure defining the wind
       PhotPtr p                   the packet at the point of activation
       int nres                    the process which activates the Macro Atom

Returns:
       int nres                    the process by which deactivation occurs
       PhotPtr p                   the packet following deactivation
       int escape                  in principle this tells us whether de-activation is
                                   via an r-packet or a k-packet. For this routine at the 
                                   moment only r-packets are possible so it always returns
                                   escape = 1

Synopsis:

       macro_pops uses the Monte Carlo estimators to compute a set
       of level populations for levels of macro atoms.


Arguments: one -> pointer to the wind 
           xne -> current value for electron density in this shell

Returns:   Should compute the fractional level populations for 
          macro atoms and store them in "levden" array. The ion fractions
          are also computed and stored in w[n].density[nion]


Description:


Notes:  
         This routine uses a matrix inversion method to get the level populations.
         For now the matrix solver used is the LU decomposition method provided
         by the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL, which is free). This requires the
         include files that I've added to the top of this file and access to the
         GSL "library" file (I've added the library into the Makefile too). I found
         GSL to be very easy to install but if there are problems in the future we
         may need to switch to another matrix solver. (SS, Apr 04)

                                    Imperial College London
Synopsis:

       macro_gov is a new routine that will sit at a higher level in the code than either matom or kpkt
       and will govern the passage of packets between these routines. At the moment, since matom and kpkt 
       call each other it call all get rather confusing and loads of nested subroutine calls ensue. 
       macro_gov removes this by calling matom and kpkt which on return tell macro_gov to either return
       an r-packet to resonate or make another call to either kpkt or matom as appropriate.



Arguments:   
       WindPtr w                   the ptr to the structure defining the wind
       PhotPtr p                   the packet at the point of activation
       int nres                    the process which activates the Macro Atom
       int matom_or_kpkt           to tell us if we should initially excite a
                                   Macro Atom or create a k-packet. For Macro Atom
                                   it is set to 1 for a k-packet it is set to 2.
       int which_out               set to 1 if return is via macro atom and 2 if via kpkt

           

Returns:   Will return an r-packet after (possibly) several calls to matom and kpkt

       int nres                    the process by which re-emission occurs
       PhotPtr p                   the packet following re-emission



Description:


Notes:   I've written this to be as general as possible so that if we want to improve the treatment of simple
         ions it should not need to be re-written.

         During the spectrum calculation the emission of r-packets within the spectral region of interest
         is done using emissivities obtained during the ionization cycles. Therefore whenever an r-packet
         is converted into a k-packet or an excited macro atom that ends the need to follow the packet any
         further. To deal with this, this routine sets the weights of such packets to zero. Upon return to 
         trans_phot these packets will then be thrown away.

         
History:
          SS   June 04 - coding began
          SS   June 04 - modified to kill photons that interact with macro atoms or
                         become k-packets during the specrum calculation part of the code.
          SS   June 04 - returns 1 if last interaction was with full macro atom. 0 otherwise.
          SS   Sep  04 - added return of "which_out"
	  ksl	0803	Added lines which modify p->origin to reflect the fact
	  		that a photn has been processed by an interaction with a
			macro atom.  Basically, what I have done is simply to 
			add 10 to the origin.  This was done to account for the fact
			that its hard to constrain the frequence range of a photon
			processed by a macro atom
