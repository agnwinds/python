/** 
 * @brief The core of the implementation of Macro Atoms in python
 *
 * @param [in,out]  PhotPtr p   the packet at the point of activation and deactivation
 * @param [in,out]  int nres    the process which activates and deactivates the Macro Atom
 * @param [out]  int escape  flag to tell us whether the matom de-activation
 *                             is via an r-packet (1) or a k-packet (0)
 * @return 0
 *
 * Matom is the core of the implementation of Leon Lucy's Macro Atom
 * approach to dealing with radiation-matter interactions. It is called whenever
 * a photon packet activates a macro atom. As input it takes the process by
 * which activation occurred (identified by the label "nres") which allow it 
 * to deduce the level that has been excited. It then calculates all the 
 * Macro Atom jumping/deactivaion probabilities following Lucy and so deduces
 * the process by which deactivation occurs. At output "nres" identifies this 
 * process and the packet information has been updated.
 * 
 *
 * ###Notes###
 * ksl-- There is a lot of arithmetic required to keep track of indices.  I would
 * be inclined to figure out a way to avoid this.  One possibility would be to record the
 * go_to level in an array when one is calculating the emission probabilities. This would
 * make it easier to add new processes, I suspect. 
 * 
 * CK20180801: 
 * 
 *           in non-macro atom mode, the only continuum process treates as scattering is 
 *           electron scattering, and this is assigned nres = -1. The only valid values 
 *           of nres in non-macro-atom mode are therefore nres = -1 and 0 <= nres <= nlines-1
 *           (with the lattter range covering the lines).
 * 
 *           in macro atom mode, nres = -1 indicates electron scattering, 
 *           nres = -2 indicates ff, and nres > NLINES indicates bound-free. 
 * 	     [nres == NLINES is never used. Note also that NLINES is the *max* number of lines, whereas nlines
 *	     is the *actual* number of lines. So, actually, it's not just nres = NLINES that's never used, but 
 *	     the entire range of nlines <= nres <= NLINES]
 * 
 * It would be possible to convert the for loop to a while statement.  This would avoid the
 * break statement in the middle.  
 * 
 * History:
 *   Feb 04  SS   Coding began.
 *   Mar 04  SS   Minor changes made (based on comments from ksl)
 *   04apr ksl A. Eliminated some unnecessary if statements.  These are indicated
 *       by the words extra.  Stuart should remove the lines assuming he
 *       agrees.
 *       B. Changed the logic of the major do loop so that the break is moved
 *       higher in the do loop.  Stuart, the intent is to make the
 *       code more readable, and to reduce the level of nesting. 
 *       C. Corrected an error that on upward bb transitions seemed to leave
 *       the macro-atom in the same state as previously.
 *       D. Shamelessly modified some of the comments to make it more
 *       straightforward for me to understand.
 *       E. m = m + 1 --> m++ in several places
 *       F. Modified selections to allow simple lines to be read in but
 *       not to affect matom.  nlines_macro is the number on macro-lines
 *       read in and these are the first elements in the line structure
 *       G. Modified the way matom determines that a transition is a photo
 *       ionization transition bo be consitent with change made in
 *       resonate.
 *           Apr 04   SS   Modifications to include collisional jumps/deactivation included.
 *           May 04   SS   Bug corrected for identification of line (nres is the place of the
 *                         line in the ORDERED list, not the input list).
 *           Jun 04   SS   Modified to carry the "escape" variable to identify de-activation
 *                         via r-packets and k-packets - avoids the need to call kpkt from
 *                         within this routine
 *           Jun 04   SS   Adding collisional ionization as an upwards jump possibility. No collisional
 *                         recombination for the moment.
 *           Jun 04   SS   Now putting in collisional recombination too.
 *           July04   SS   Modifying so that this routine does not call alpha_sp but rather uses 
 *                         pre-computed (stored values) for the spontaneous recombination coefficient.
 *                         This is an effort to speed up the code.
 *   06may ksl 57+ -- Adapted for use with plasma structure.  Changed call to
 *       eliminate passing entire w array
 *   06jun ksl 57g -- Split macro variables into a separate structure. The structue
 *       which is created in gridwind, is only created if there are macroatoms.
 *   06jul ksl 57h -- In the process of speeding up the program in the simple 
 *       non-macro atom case, I tried to make sure that matom and the 
 *       derivative routiens were not called at all.  Note that at present
 *       the macroatom case is quite slow, due to what is happening in
 *       matom.  I am suspicious that it could be speeded up a lot.
 *         07jul     SS    Experimenting with retaining jumping/emission probabilities to save time.

 *          Jun 04  SS   Modified to include the "escape" variable to identify excitation of
