 * @brief The core of the implementation of Macro Atoms in python

 * @param [in,out]  PhotPtr p   the packet at the point of activation and deactivation
 * @param [in,out]  int nres    the process which activates and deactivates the Macro Atom
 * @param [out]  int escape  flag to tell us whether the matom de-activation
 *                             is via an r-packet (TRUE) or a k-packet (FALSE)
 * @return returns the number of level jumps before exiting the routine, or -1
 * if an error was encountered.
 *
 * @details 
 * Matom is the core of the implementation of Leon Lucy's Macro Atom
 * approach to dealing with radiation-matter interactions. It is called whenever
 * a photon packet activates a macro atom. As input it takes the process by
 * which activation occurred (identified by the label "nres") which allow it 
 * to deduce the level that has been excited. It then calculates all the 
 * Macro Atom jumping/deactivation probabilities following Lucy and so deduces
 * the process by which deactivation occurs. 
 * 
 * The two possibilities are that the macro-atom deactivates by an r-packet
 * (radiative deactivations) or a k-packet (putting the energy  into the
 * thermal pool) as indicated by the variable escape.
 * 
 * At the point where the routine exits, nres idenifies the process of
 * deactivation and the packet information is also updated 
 * 
 *
 * ###Notes###
 * 
 * in macro atom mode, nres = -1 indicates electron scattering, 
 * nres = -2 indicates ff, and nres > NLINES indicates bound-free. 
 * [nres == NLINES is never used. Note also that NLINES is the *max* number of lines, whereas nlines
 * is the *actual* number of lines. So, actually, it's not just nres = NLINES that's never used, but 
 * the entire range of nlines <= nres <= NLINES]
 *
