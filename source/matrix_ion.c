/**
 * @brief      A matrix solver for the ionization state in a cell
 *
 * @param [in,out] PlasmaPtr  xplasma   The plasma cell we are working on
 * @param [in] int  mode   What type of model to use for J_nu - 1=fitted model 2=blackbody
 * @return     0 if successful
 *
 * The abundances contained in xplasma are updated witht he results of
 * the calculation.
 *
 * @details
 * modes:
 *   1 - use a power law and or exponential model for J
 *   2 - use a dilute BB model for J defined by t_r and w
 * The general structure of matrix_ion_populations is as follows:
 * First we compute all of the rates that we have data for linking all ionization stages
 * We make an initial guess at the electron density
 * We attempt to solve the ionization rates matrix, and produce a new guess at the electron density
 * We then calculate new rates, re-solve and proceed until the electron density converges.
 * We solve the matrix equation A x = b for the vector x, where A is a square rate matrix linking
 * each state with each other state (often containing zeros if the ions arent linked) b is a vector
 * containing the total density of each element arranged in a certain way (see later) and
 * x is a vector containing the relative ion populations. We invert A to get x=bA^-1
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * Uses a relative abundance scheme, in order to reduce large number issues
 *
 * Various parameters for the calculation, and in particular the t_e are passed
 * via the PlasmaPtr
