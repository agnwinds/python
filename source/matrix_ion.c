  Synopsis:   

int   matrix_ion_populations (xplasma,mode)
  
  Arguments:		
     PlasmaPtr xplasma;		The cell in question -
     int mode;			1 - use a power law and or exponential model for J
     				2 - use a dilute BB model for J - t_r and w are those 
				parameters in xplasma


  Returns:
	

 	
  Description:	

	The general structure of matrix_ion_populations is as follows:
	First we compute all of the rates that we have data for linking all ionization stages 
	We make an initial guess at the electron density
	We attempt to solve the ionization rates matrix, and produce a new guess at the electron density
	We now calculate new rates, resolve and proceed until the electron density converges.


 
  Notes:

  This routine is a first try at implementing a matrix solver for the ionization state in a cell. 
	This was motivated by the desire to incorporate more ionization and recombination processes
	into python.

        dimensions of matrices/vectors. Should be consistent
        with arrays passed to routine.

    populations	 
    	1d array of length nrows, containing entries
        for vector x - modified by this routine
