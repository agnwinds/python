/**
 * @brief      A matrix solver for the ionization state in a cell
 *
 * @param [in,out] PlasmaPtr  xplasma   The plasma cell we are working on
 * @param [in] int  mode   What type of model to use for J_nu - 1=fitted model 2=blackbody
 * @return     0 if successful
 *
 * The abundances contained in xplasma are updated witht he results of
 * the calculation.
 *
 * @details
 * modes:
 *   1 - use a power law and or exponential model for J
 *   2 - use a dilute BB model for J defined by t_r and w
 * The general structure of matrix_ion_populations is as follows:
 * First we compute all of the rates that we have data for linking all ionization stages
 * We make an initial guess at the electron density
 * We attempt to solve the ionization rates matrix, and produce a new guess at the electron density
 * We then calculate new rates, re-solve and proceed until the electron density converges.
 * We solve the matrix equation A x = b for the vector x, where A is a square rate matrix linking
 * each state with each other state (often containing zeros if the ions arent linked) b is a vector
 * containing the total density of each element arranged in a certain way (see later) and
 * x is a vector containing the relative ion populations. We invert A to get x=bA^-1
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * Uses a relative abundance scheme, in order to reduce large number issues
 *
 * Various parameters for the calculation, and in particular the t_e are passed
 * via the PlasmaPtr

  /* Now, we replace the first line for each element with 1's and 0's. This is done because we actually have more equations

     elements (which relate to other elements (in the chemicalsense) with zeros. This is equivalent to the equation
     1*n1+1*n2+1*n3 = n_total - i.e. the sum of all the partial number densities adds up to the total number density for that
     element. This loop also produces the 'b matrix'. This is the right hand side of the matrix equation, and represents the
     total number density for each element. This can be a series of 1's for each row in the matrix relating to the ground
     state of the repsective element, however one can just use the total number density for that elements and then the
     densities which the solver computes are just the actual number densities for each ion. This does mean that different rows
     are orders of magnitude different, so one can imagine numerical issues. However each element is essentially solved for
