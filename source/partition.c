 *
 * @bug It seems likely that this file and levels.c should be combined

 * some of the modes that need investigation as well.

 * @brief      calculates the partition functions
 * 	for a single cell in the grid (and then calls a routine that
 * 	calculates the level populations
 *
 * @param [in] PlasmaPtr  xplasma   A plasma cell in the wind
 * @param [in] int  mode   An integer which determines the way in which the partition funciton will be calculated
 * @return     Always returns 0
 *
 * @details
 *
 * The possibilites are:
 * * NEBULARMODE_TR 0        LTE using t_r
 * * NEBULARMODE_TE 1        LTE using t_e
 * * NEBULARMODE_ML93 2      ML93 using a nebular approximation correction to LTE
 * * NEBULARMODE_NLTE_SIM 3  // Non_LTE with SS modification (Probably could be removed)
 * * NEBULARMODE_LTE_GROUND 4        // A mode which forces all levels to the GS - this is used when we are modelling J_nu.

 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * 0800802 - This is a rewritten version of two routines, do_partitions
 * 	and partition.   It is still true that levels is almost identical
 * 	to some of the code here and therefore it is unclear why it is needed.
 * 	levels is always called from partition_functions

/** 
 * @brief      calculates the partition functions
 * 	for a pair of ions at a given temperature. 
 *
 *
 * @param [in] PlasmaPtr  xplasma   - the cell we are interested in. Used to communicate back
 * @param [in] int  xnion   The ion number for the upper ion of a pair 
 * @param [in] double  temp  the temperature we are using for the saha equation. 
 * @param [in] double  weight The ratio of the intensity of the radiation field to that of a BB
 * @return     changes the partition functions of just two ions we are currently working on
 *
 * @details
 * 	This routine is used 
 * 	to support the pairwise ioinization state calculations where 
 * 	the saha equation is applied to a pair of states at a
 * 	temperature, then corrected. Part of this is 
 * 	a requirement to get the partition functions at that 
 * 	temperature for just two states of interest. It is 
 * 	wasteful to calculate all of the states at each temperature.
 *
 * 	The results are stored in xplasma->partition[nion]
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * @bug According to the historical notes, there is no need for the weight term in the calculation 
 * since this is only called when
 * we are making the assumption that we are in LTE for the saha equation.
 *
 * However
 * 2012Sep nsh - added weight as a calling value - this allows one to produce gs
 *                only with w=0, or LTE with w=1 or to produce a correction factor with W = the measured value
 *
 * One of the ways in which this routine differs from partition_functions is that
 * here the temperature and weight are passed to the routing directly instead of
 * being taken from the Plasma structure.
