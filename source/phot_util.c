 * This file contains utilities which can be used to work with photon structues.  It also
 * contains routines to calculate the distances to intersections of spheres and cones.  The
 * routines included here should not be tightly tied to a particular wind model.   The one
 * exception at present is ds_to_cone which calculates the distance to a bifurcated cone.

//OLD
//OLD
//OLD
//OLD   56d -- Cones have become more prominent in python with time.  Originally
//OLD   they were used simply to define the inner and outer edges of the
//OLD   wind, that is   to determine when a photon entered the wind.  The wind was/is
//OLD   assumed to be a biconical flow, and therefore the most naturally was defined in
//OLD   terms of a footpoint in the disk for the innermost/outermost stream line
//OLD   and a slope.
//OLD
//OLD   It was expanced when rtheta coordanates were introduced
//OLD   to handle find when one had hit the theta coordinate boundaries.  And in
//OLD   56d we also want it to handle the case where the grid cells have variable
//OLD   z coordinates.  Therefore one needs to be quite careful, Since ds_to_cone
//OLD   is the ultimate name of the routine I would like to use, the first step
//OLD   I took was to change the name of the old routine to ds_to_windcone.  This
//OLD   should allow me to replace the old routine incrementally.
//OLD
//OLD   56d -- With python 56d the variable defining a cone were changed to be
//OLD   the point on the z axis intercepted by the cone (extended) through
//OLD   the disk, and the slope.
//OLD
//OLD   Our approach is as follows:
//OLD
//OLD   The cone is defined by  z=z_o + dz/drho *drho
//OLD   The photon is defined by X=X_o + LMN s
//OLD
//OLD   Unless dz/drho = 0, this turns into a simple quadratic equation that must
//OLD   be solved.  We work in the northen hemisphere only.
//OLD
//OLD   There are issues concerning what to do so one crosses the disk plane.  For
//OLD         finding how far a photon can travel in a cell, we are *not* interested
//OLD   in the possibility that the photon hits the cone on the other side of
//OLD   the disk plane, but for a photon travelling out of the wind we are
//OLD   very interested in this possibility.
//OLD
//OLD History:
//OLD   05jul   ksl     Created so that cylvar coordinates could be incorporated

//OLD   06sep   ksl     57h -- Corrected an error discovered by SS in the setup of the

//OLD                   changes that could speed it up a bit since the magnitude
