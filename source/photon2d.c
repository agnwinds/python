 *
 * @brief  This file contains the routines which translate
 * photons, both inside and outside of the domains.
 *
 * Except for translating the photon the routines do as
 * litle as possible w.r.t modifying any of the other
 * information in the photon structure.
 *
 * There is a steering routine translate which calle
 * either translate_in_wind or translate_in_space, depending
 * on whether a photon bundle is in a wind domain or in space.
 * The routines translate the photon until hits something,
 * either the edge of the wind, or the edge of a cell, or
 * a resonance and then return with a status noting what
 * has happened.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * Some of these routines pass the WindPtr for the entire
 * wind which should not be necessary and had been removed
 * in favor of using wmain.  It would probably be a good idea
 * to that here.
 *
 * These routines are called from trans_phot.  One could argue
 * that the filename is misnamed for that reason.

/**
 * @brief      a steering routine that either calls translate_in_space or translate_in_wind  depending upon the
 * 	current location of the photon.
 *
 * @param [in] WindPtr  w   A pointer to the wind
 * @param [in, out] PhotPtr  pp   A photon
 * @param [in] double  tau_scat   the depth at which the photon should scatter
 * @param [ out] double *  tau   The optical depth associated with a resonanant scatter when
 * this is the reason the photon has stopped
 * @param [in, out] int *  nres   The number of the resonance if the photon stopped.
 * due to reaching the scattering optical depth
 * @return     A status that states what caused the photon to stp as it did
 *
 * @details
 *
 * The routine takes the current position of the photon and determines
 * where it is.  Depending on this it calls either translate_in_space
 * or translate_in_wind
 *
 * On exit, the position of the photon will have been updated.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * Translate controls the flow of the photon through one grid cell.  In Python,
 * there are additional possibilities since there are wind free regions.
 *
 * The routine first calls where_in_wind which returns the correct domain for a given position, or domain 0 if the
 * position is not in the wind of a domain.  The photon structure does not have the domain
 * number directly encoded, but it can be obtained from the grid number, which where in_grid updates
 *
 *
 * This construction is
 * used so that the calling routines for translate (trans_phot and extract) can be the same
 * in the 1 and 2d versions.

 * @brief      calculates the photon pathlength to the edge of the wind.

 *
 * @details
 * Python defines the boundaries of the wind in term of the intersection
 * of a biconical flow (defined by an inner and outer windcone) and
 * an inner and outer radius centered on the star.	 If the user is interested
 * in a biconical flow, he/she will most likely set the radii so that they
 * do not truncate the wind.  Similarly, by choosing parameters for the windcones
 * properly, one can assure that one has a completely spherical flow.  However,
 * the user may also perversely set the parameters to that both the conical
 * flow boundaries and the min and maximum radius come into play.
 *
 * Usually, one would
 * efine the two types of The two types of boundaries are
 * sually defined so that one includes the other and so the cones apply when one is
 * ealing with a CV type wind, while the inner and outer radius applies for a spherical
 * odel.  However this routine does not require this to be the case, since it just
 * alculates where the edges are.
 *
 * n any event, if you are inside the wind already ds_to_wind calculates the distance to the edge of the wind.
 * If you are outside, It will also be to the nearest edge.
 *
 * The routine distinguishes between  two basic cases.  Either the photon is already in the wind
 * in which case one looks for the nearest boundary, or the photon is not currently
 * in the wind and you have to translate it until it reaches the the boundary (or
 * VERY_BIG)
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * There is no guarantee that you will still be in the region defined by the grid.
 *
 * @bug 1802 -ksl - At present this routine for imported models this routine only deals with
 * cylindrical models.  Additionally for imported models we skip all of the
 * of the wind_cones.  This is inefficient, and needs to be corrected for
 * rtheta and spherical models which can easily be handled using wind cones.
 *
 * ksl 2201 - It is unclear what the comment I made in 1802 actually means anymore.
