Description:	
 	

Notes:
	In Monte, translate controls the flow of the photon through one grid cell.  In Python,
	there are additional possibilities since there are wind free regions.  This construction is
	used so that the calling routines for translate (trans_phot and extract) can be the same
	in the 1 and 2d versions.

	where_in_wind returns the correct domain for a given position, or domain 0 if the
	position is not in the wind of a domain.  The photon structure does not have the domain
	number directly incoded, but it can be obtained from the grid number, which where in_grid updates

Synopsis:   

	double ds_to_wind(pp)  calculates the photon pathlength to the edge of the wind.  
   
Arguments:		
	PhotPtr pp;.
	
Returns:

 	The distance to the nearest boundary of the wind.  
  
Description:

	Python defines the boundaries of the wind in term of the intersection
	of a biconical flow (defined by an inner and outer windcone) and 
	an inner and outer radius centered on the star.	 If the user is interested
	in a biconical flow, he/she will most likely set the radii so that they
	do not truncate the wind.  Similarly, by choosing parameters for the windcones
	properly, one can assure that one has a completely spherical flow.  However,
	the user may also perversely set the parameters to that both the conical
	flow boundaries and the min and maximum radius come into play.
	
	 Usually, one would
	define the two types of The two types of boundaries are
	usually defined so that one includes the other and so the cones apply when one is
	dealing with a CV type wind, while the inner and outer radius applies for a spherical
	model.  However this routine does not require this to be the case, since it just
	calculates where the edges are.
	
	 In any event, f you are inside the wind already ds_to_wind calculates the distance to the edge of the wind. 
	If you are outside, It will also be to the nearest edge.  	

	The routine distinguishes between  two basic cases.  Either the photon is already in the wind
	in which case one looks for the nearest boundary, or the photon is not currently
	in the wind and you have to translate it until it reaches the the boundary (or
	VERY_BIG) 
Notes:
	There is no guarantee that you will still be in the region defined by the grid.

History:
 	1997	ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort. 
 	98dec	ksl	Updated to add an inner and outer radial boundary.
	99oct	ksl	The existing version of this code appears to contain
			an attempt to deal with what looks to be a roundoff
			problem when the intersection point is at large radii
			but at a radii less than VERY_BIG.  I have made the 
			fudge bigger in an attempt to push through the boundary
			and logged the error.  There ought to be a better fix
			involving not letting the photon get too far from
			the WD but I am worried about interactions between
			this routine and other portions of the code. ???

        I have been trying to understand the behavior of ds_to_wind which 
        calculates the distance to the edge of the wind (from outside the
        wind.  There were two problems I believe neither of which is solved
        to my satisfaction.  The first, simpler, problem is that at very
        large distances adding DFUDGE to ds does not "punch through" since 
        DFUDGE is so small relative to DS that it is lost in roundoff errors.
        The second problem is that ds_to_wind includes calculates the distance
        to the outer radius of the wind, but that where_in_wind says that
        the photon is still in the wind at the outer boundary.  where_in_wind
        does not have a separate return value to say that the photon is still
        in the wind_cone but beyond the outer boundary.  What to do needs 
        researching because a photon can be eclipsed even if it is beyond
        the outer boundary.  AT present ds_to_wind is set up so that it 
        it keeps calculating ds_to_wind until it punches thourh this outer
        sphere.  I have simplified the logic for this from the previous program
        but exactly what should be done needs to be determined! ????		

	05jul	ksl	Changed call from ds_to_cone to ds_to_cone as
			added cylvar coord system.  Otherwise routine is
			currently unchanged.  
	15aug	ksl	Modifications for domains.  The asumption we make

			regions at this point, and that we are looking
			for the closest wind boundary.

 Synopsis:   
	translate_in_wind translates the photon within a single cell in the wind.  
  
 Arguments:		

	
 Returns:
  
Description:

	responsible for scattering (or absorbing) the photon bundle.  

	These last two quantities are calculated in ds_calculate and simply passed back.

 Synopsis:   
	 walls determines whether the photon has encountered the star of disk or
	 reached the edges of the grid and returns the appropriate
	status.  
  
 Arguments:		
	PhotPtr p,pold		the current and previous description of the photon bundle.
	
 Returns:
         The photon has hit the star				P_HIT_STAR
         The photon has hit the disk				P_HIT_DISK
         The photon has reached the edge of grid 		P_ESCAPE
         The status is undeterminable                    5
         
 If a photon does not fall into one of these categories, walls returns the old status, which is stored in
 p->istat 
 
Description:	


    pold is the place where the photon was before the last attempt to move the photon forward.
    p on input is a proposed location for photon before considering whethe one has hit a boundary. The
    location of p is either at the edge of a cell, or at the position of a resonance.  So pold should
   be a valid position for the photon, but p may need to be adjusted. 

   If one of the walls has been hit, the routine should have moved the photon to that wall, but not
   othewise changed it.  

   The routine does calculate the normal to the surface that was hit, which is inteneded to
   be used by trans_phot to redirect the photon
 	

Notes:

This really does determine whether the photon is in the grid, as opposed to whether the photon
has reached a radial distance geo.rwind.  I am not sure whether this is what we want???.
