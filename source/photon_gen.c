 Synopsis: define_phot (p, w, f1, f2, nphot_tot, ioniz_or_final, iwind, freq_sampling)
is the controlling routine for creating the underlying photon distribution.
   
Arguments:		
	PhotPtr p;
	WindPtr w;
	double f1,f2;  		The freqency minimum and maximum if a uniform distribution 
				is selected 
	long nphot_tot;		The total number of photons that need to be generated to reach 
				the luminosity. This is not necessarily the number of photons 
				which will be generated by the call to define_phot, which instead 
				is defined by NPHOT 
	int ioniz_or_final	0 -> this is for the wind ionization calculation, 
				        1-> it is for the final spectrum calculation 
	int iwind		-1-> Do not consider wind photons under any circumstances
				0  ->Consider wind photons.  There is no need to recalculate the 
					relative contribution to number of photons from the wind
					unless the frequencies have changed
				1 -> Force a recalculation of the fraction of photons from the wind.
					This is necessary because after each ionization recalculation
					one needs to recalculate the flux fraction from the wind.
     int freq_sampling		0 --> old uniform approach, currently used for detailed spectrum calculation
				1 --> minimum fractions ins various bins to better approximate heating
					of plasma
Returns:
 
 
Description:	

		
Notes:

History:
 	97jan   ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort. 
 	98mar	ksl	Made modifications to incorporate radiation from the wind. 
 	98dec	ksl	Made mods which cause choices based on, e.g., geo.bl_radiation, to
			reflect C convention that 0 is false, non-zero is true
 	98dec	ksl	Made mods intended to assure that no matter which sources are
 			involved one always generates NPHOT photons
	01apr	ksl	Fixed problem in which phot_windstart was nonsensical if no
			wind photons.
	01aug	ksl	Modified flux fractions associated with various sources so that
			hubeny and kurucz models can be accommodated more accurately.
	01dec	ksl	Accommodated possibility of non-uniform sampling in frequency
			space. (python_40).  This involved converting photon_gen to
			a steering routine, and separating the other functions of
			photon_gen into a routine which performs initialization
			and one that generates photons.  A structure bands was
			added to store invormation about how to split the photons
			among the various energy bands, and routines init_bands and
			populate_were added to incoporate banding.  
	02jan	ksl	Modified the nature of the disk structure so now a single
			structure for entire disk (to make intepolation possible).
	04aug	ksl	Modified to reflect new spectrum type description
	13mar	ksl	Changed nphot_tot to long because it is possible
			for it to exceed the range of a normal integer
	1409	ksl	Added a loop to record the original weights of all photons
			created

routine through the geo structure, rather than a more obvious method.  The routine was 
created when a banded approach was defined, but the whole section might be more obvious.

 Synopsis: disk_init calculates the total luminosity and the luminosity between freqqmin and freqmax 
	of the disk.  More importantly disk_init divides the disk into annulae such that each 
	annulus contributes and equal amount to the lumionosity of the disk (within the frequency 
	limits).  Thus disk_init initializes the structure "disk".


  
Arguments:		
	rmin,rmax		min and max radii of disk
	m			mass of central object
	mdot			mass accretion rate
	freqmin,freqmax		frequency interval of interest

Returns:

	The routine returns the total luminosity of the disk as well
	as 
	
 	*ftot			total flux in the frequency interval of 
 					interest.
 	
Description:	

		
Notes:
	The positional parameters x and v are at the edge of the ring,
	but many of the other parameters are at the mid point.

	Bug 	disk_init	This routine gets similar information throuh geo and through the call
	Bug	........	Need to adopt a consistent philosophy, and come in through one or the other

History:
 	97jan	ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort. 
 	97oct8	ksl	Added velocity to the disk structure calculation
 	98mar25	ksl	Removed a line which forced disk[NMAX-1].r to
 			be the maximum radius of the disk.  This was done
 			because if one is concerned with high frequencies the disk
 			may not in fact radiate at all beyond a certain radius.  This was
 			creating problems in planck where if the minimum desired is too high
 			compared to kT/h.  But this may negatively affect the part of the
 			program which keeps track of where photons hit.
	02feb	ksl	Modified the nature of the disk structure so now a single
			structure for entire disk (to make intepolation possible).
	02feb	ksl	Assured that velocities were calculated at the same
			place as the positions so that interpolation is
			possible and also that positions were defined
			out to .r[NRINGS]
	04dec	ksl	Moved determination of spectype out of do loop, since it
			only needs to be calculated once and was genrating a -O3
			warning
	06jul	ksl	57g -- Fixed problem that we had previously been
			passing disk gravity in cgs to emittance, rather than
			log g as expected.
