 * @brief      int calculates the photoionization rate coefficient for an ion in a given cell
 *
 * @param [in] int  nion   The ion being ionized (or the index to an inner shell cross section)
 * @param [in] PlasmaPtr  xplasma   The cell for which rates are calulated
 * @param [in] int  mode Use either a piecewise model (1) or a blackbody model (2) for J_nu
 * @param [in] type Compute either an outer shell (1) or inner shell (2) rate
 * @return     The photioinization rate coefficient for the ion.
 *
 * @details
 *  calc_pi_rate  calculates the photoionization rate coefficient for ion
 * 	nion, based upon the mean intensity stored in cell xplasma
 * 	The mode tells the subroutine wether we are modelling the
 * 	mean intensity as a dilute blackbody (mode2) or as a series
 * 	of power laws and exponentials (mode1). The type allows for the calculation
 *      of inner shell rates - in this case nion is the index into an inner
 * 	shell cross section record - this links to the relevant ion internally.
 *      the reason for the difference is that there is exactly one outer rate
 * 	per ion, but there can be many inner shell rates. Most of the information
 * 	needed for the calculations is stored in the xplasma structure (e.g. temperature
 * 	and spectral model)
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * This was created in Summer 2014 in preparation for matrix ionization solver. Previously, this code
 * was contained in two subroutines bb_correct_2 and pl_correct_2.The functionality of these two
 * have ben combined into one - hence the requirement for the mode parameter. It was further extended
 * to deal with inner shell rates - hence the type parameter
