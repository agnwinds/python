 * @author ksl
 * @date   May, 2018
 *
 * @brief  py_wind is a program which can be used to display various parameters of a wind
as calculated by python.  This is the main routine.
 *
 *
 * Arguments:
 *
 * py_wind [-h] [-s] [-p parameter_file] [root]
 *
 * where
 * * -h 	prints out a short help file and exits (see help routine below)
 * * -s	causes certain parameters in the windsave file to be printed out
 * as individual ascii files after which the program exits
 * * -d	In cases where a windsavefile was made for each ionization
 * cycle, this prints out ascii files for "certain" parameters
 * for each of the ionization cycles, as well as the ascii files
 * for the final ionization cycle (if windsave files for each
 * ionization cycle were not created then -s and -d are
 * equivalent).
 * * -p parameter file
 * Instead of reading the choices from the command line read them
 * from a parameter file
 * root	optional root name of wind_save file.  If this is not given,
 * the user is queried for this
 *
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * Py_wind simply reads and then displays portions of the wind file created by python.
 * It can select various parameters from the wind and it can write them to files so that
 * the variables can be plotted.
 *
 * The normal mode of running py_wind is to run it interactively.  As you run it interactively
 * the variables you select are displayed ont the screen.  The variables that you display
 * can also be written to files (depending on the answer to the question Make_files)
 *
 * The commands that were executed in the interactive will be stored in py_wind.pf (if you end
 * with a "q", and not an EOF response to the choice question)  EOF terminates the program
 * at that point before the command file is written to py_wind.pf
 *
 * The py_wind.pf file is useful if you want to run the exact same set of commands on another
 * windfile. You should rename py_wind.pf to something_else.pf and run py_wind on that
 * data set using the -p something_else.pf option
 *
 * The command_line switches -d and -s are intended to produce a standard set of output files sufficient
 * for many purposes.
 *
 * ###Notes####
 *
 * The files that are produced  can contain either the original gridding which was used by python, in which
 * case the file prefix will be "x.", or "z", in which case it will be regridded to a
 * linear array.  This option is intended so one can create a contour plot more easily.
 *
 * The structure of py_wind is intended to make it easy to add additional variables to print to the
 * scen or a file.  Basically to add a new option, one needs to update the list of possibilities,
 * add a new choice statement in one_choice, and then write the routine that grabs a new variable (or
 * calculates a value from several), and add this to either py_wind_subs or py_wind_macro_subs.
 *
 * Because this was intended as a diagnositic routine, some of the more esoteric choices may seem
 * a bit odd today.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: py_wind has not been adapted to handle multiple domains.  Use windsave2table instead.

be allocated.  Howver, one cannot assign w in a subroutine.  Therefore
the old call, namely wind_read(w,windsavefile, will not work.  The statement
w=wmain is a way around this since wmain is external and therefore can
be assigned.  Then w can be set to this ptr and all is restored. The
use of w is endemic in the program. and it is always called through main.
