 Synopsis:
	py_wind is a program which can be used to display various parameters of a wind
		as calculated by python.  This is the main routine.

Arguments:		

	py_wind [-h] [-s] [-p parameter_file] [root]

	where
		-h 	prints out a short help file and exits (see help routine below)
		-s	causes certain parameters in the windsave file to be printed out 
			as individual ascii files after which the program exits
	 	-d	In cases where a windsavefile was made for each ionization 
			cycle, this prints out ascii files for "certain" parameters
			for each of the ionization cycles, as well as the ascii files
			for the final ionization cycle (if windsave files for each
			ionization cycle were not created then -s and -d are 
			equivalent).
		-p parameter file
			Instead of reading the choices from the command line read them
			from a parameter file
		root	optional root name of wind_save file.  If this is not given,
			the user is queried for this


Returns:
 
Description:	
	
	Py_wind simply reads and then displays portions of the wind file created by python.  
	It can select various parameters from the wind and it can write them to files so that
	the variables can be plotted. 
       
	The normal mode of running py_wind is to run it interactively.  As you run it interactively
	the variables you select are displayed ont the screen.  The variables that you display
	can also be written to files (depending on the answer to the question Make_files) 

	The commands that were executed in the interactive will be stored in py_wind.pf (if you end 
	with a "q", and not an EOF response to the choice question)  EOF terminates the program 
	at that point before the command file is written to py_wind.pf
	
	The py_wind.pf file is useful if you want to run the exact same set of commands on another 
	windfile. You should rename py_wind.pf to something_else.pf and run py_wind on that 
	data set using the -p something_else.pf option

	The command_line switches -d and -s are intended to produce a standard set of output files sufficient
	for many purposes.  

	
Notes:

	The files that are produced  can contain either the original gridding which was used by python, in which 
	case the file prefix will be "x.", or "z", in which case it will be regridded to a 
	linear array.  This option is intended so one can create a contour plot more easily.


History:
 	97jun	ksl	Coding on py_wind began.
 	97sep13	ksl	Modified slightly to reflect the fact that EOF exits program through rdpar
 	97oct2	ksl	Modified so that t_e and t_r can be printed separately
 	98feb	ksl	Modified to add the amount of energy and momentum flux absorbed per cell
 				as output possibilities. Also in py_ion added the ability to print out the
 				luminosity in CIV if the wind was assumed to be a thin plasma.
	98jul	ck	Modified so the number of ionzations and recombinations can be checked
			against one another
	98oct	ksl	Modified abs_sum and lum_suim so that the various processes which go
				into heating and cooling the plasma can be displayed individually.
	99nov	ksl	Added an additional option to create a fixed set of output files. 
	00mar	ksl	Updated main routine and write_array subroutine to allow one to choose
			whether to relinearize the grid or to leave it in as it was in the windfile
			Added output files for velocity.
	01sep	ksl	Updated ion_summary so that either concentrations or ion fractions could be
			examined.
	02apr	ksl	Fixed so could read wind_save files with various sizes 
	02jun	ksl	Fixed and so could read diagnostic outputs when one had printed out 
			results at each iteration of the ionization cycle
	04nov	ksl     Made major modification to eliminate duplicative code, by adding new
			task display.  Also introduced variable py_wind_project to switch
			between raw mode (regardless of coord system), and a mode which projects
			on to a yz plane the system of coordinates.
	04nov	ksl	Added a choice to explore what is the situation at a specific position
			in the grid.  This was added to see how different coordinate systems
			compared.
	05jan	ksl	54f -- Modified			
	05apr	ksl	56 -- Eliminated MDIM from the routines in this file.  
			MDIM is isolated to routines like display.  Added swithches to
			change choices regarding what, if anything is printed to a 
			file.
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Moved all of the subroutines to a separate routine py_wind_sub.c
			This is intended to facilitate the create of templates by Makefile.
	06jul	ksl	57g -- Made modifications to reflect the change in the way structures
			had been defined.
	090117	ksl	68a -- Added command line functionality so could run more easily
			in a non interactive mode
	090125	ksl	Changed functionality of I and i switches to allow for printing
			out information about the number of scatters, etc, by an ion
			in the wind.  This reflects a desire to be able to understand
			better where in the wind ions are "active" in creating the
			spectrum.
	111002	ksl	Added rho to one of the options
	111125	ksl	Modified the way the choice options are displayed, and put the various
			choices into a subroutine.  The goal here is to make py_wind easier
			to run from the command line.  The output files also been modifed
			so that we see which cells are in the wind and so the cell numbers are
			printed out.
	111125	ksl	Incorporated a crude capability to use a parameter file that takes
			a series of commands and prints out the files associated with them.
	111227	ksl	Added the capability to read a new wind file while the program
			is running
