//OLD  Synopsis:
//OLD   Python is a program designed to simulate the transfer of radiation in a wind.  It uses the
//OLD   Sobolev approximation.  It models a wind as a biconical flow.
//OLD
//OLD   This is the "main" routine for Python.  It's basic purpose is to gather the input variables
//OLD   and to control the flow of the program
//OLD
//OLD Arguments:
//OLD
//OLD   Usage:  py [-h] [-r] [-d] [-f] [-t time_max] xxx  or simply py
//OLD
//OLD   where xxx is the rootname or full name of a parameter file, e. g. test.pf
//OLD
//OLD   and the switches have the following meanings
//OLD
//OLD   -h      to get this help message
//OLD   -r      restart a run of the program reading the file xxx.windsave
//OLD
//OLD   -t time_max     limit the total time to approximately time_max seconds.  Note that the program checks
//OLD           for this limit somewhat infrequently, usually at the ends of cycles, because it
//OLD           is attempting to save the program outputs so that the program can be restarted with
//OLD           -r if theat is desired.
//OLD   -v num  determines the amount of information that is printed out.  If num is small, then
//OLD           less information is printed out; if num is large more is printed out.  Setting
//OLD           v to 5 causes the routine to print out all the information which outputs have
//OLD           included previously.  The current default is set to 3 which suppresses Debug, Log_silent
//OLD           and Error_silent
//OLD   -e nnn  The program stops normally stops after 1e6 errors of any type.  This switch allows one to
//OLD           adjust this number
//OLD   -d      Enters detailed or advanced mode. Allows one to access extra diagnositics and some
//OLD           other advanced commands
//OLD     -f    Fixed temperature mode - does not attempt to change the temperature of cells.
//OLD   -i      Diagnostic mode which quits after reading in inputs. Used for Travis test suite.
//OLD     --dry-run     Create a new .pf file and stop (equivalent to -i)
//OLD   -z      Mode to connect with zeus - it either runs two cycles in this is the first call - in order
//OLD           to obtain a good starting state, else it runs just one cycle. In both cases, it does
//OLD                   not attempt to seek a new temperature, but it does output heating and cooling rates
//OLD     --version     print out python version, commit hash and if there were files with uncommitted
//OLD           changes
//OLD       --rseed     set the random number seed to be time based, rather than fixed.
//OLD
//OLD
//OLD   if one simply types py or pyZZ where ZZ is the version number one is queried for a name
//OLD   of the parameter file.
//OLD
//OLD   NOTE - If this is modified, please also modify the help message in help() below
//OLD Returns:
//OLD
//OLD Description:
//OLD   Python is far too complicated to describe.  Basically it simulates the radiative transfer
//OLD   of photons through the wind of a cataclysmic variable or a star.  The kinematic formulation for
//OLD   the CV wind is due to Schlossman and Vitello while that of the star is due to Castor & Larmors.
//OLD
//OLD    Radiation from an optically thick disk, the WD star, a boundary layer and the wind itself
//OLD    may be included
//OLD
//OLD   There are 3 basic portions to the program which are easy to see in the main program.
//OLD
//OLD   1. A data gathering stage
//OLD
//OLD   2. A calculation of the state of ionization of the wind.
//OLD
//OLD   3. A calculation of a detailed spectrum in which the ionization is held fixed.
//OLD
//OLD
//OLD Notes:
//OLD   The program has been designed and tested both on Suns and MacIntoshes (with Symentec's
//OLD   C compiler).  Some of its peculiarities are due to memory limitations and relatively small
//OLD   stack sizes on the Mac.  When compiling, check to see that the global varible MAC is
//OLD   set properly in python.h.
//OLD
//OLD History:
//OLD   97jan   ksl     Coding on python began.
//OLD   97jul   ksl     Added capability model the spectrum as a function of orbital phase.
//OLD   97aug   ksl     Added boundary layer as additional source of radiation
//OLD   97aug   ksl     Added capability to extract spectra with a specific number of scatters
//OLD   97nov   ksl     Changed error and diagnostic logging
//OLD   98july  ksl     Added radiation from the wind itself
//OLD   98nov   ksl     Added spherical winds and greatly modified I/O
//OLD   99jan   ksl     Added ability to enter parameter file (w/out) root on command line
//OLD   99jul   ksl     Begin eliminating MAC dependencies
//OLD   00sep   ksl     Began work on adding a new coronal possibility
//OLD   01mar   ksl     Added a knigge wind
//OLD         01sept    ksl     Added a thierry wind
//OLD   01dec   ksl     Incorporated improved atomic data reading codes, and
//OLD                   made a variety of other major changes to the way in
//OLD                   which many of the subroutines operate.
//OLD   01dec   ksl     Revised way in which old windfile option works.  It
//OLD                   was not working at all originally, because of a
//OLD                   change I made in April.  The new method is a bit dangerous
//OLD                   because it does change a good bit of geo, since all of the
//OLD                   input data is read in.  In principle, his can create an inconsistency
//OLD                   between some of the info in geo and some in the wind array.
//OLD                   But it keeps the wind the same, which is what was desired.
//OLD   01dec   ksl     Added a general capability to python(40) so that during the
//OLD                   the ionization cycle photons do not necessarily have identical
//OLD                   weights.
//OLD   02jan   ksl     Moved specific inputs for KWD wind to knigge.c
//OLD   02feb   ksl     Added anisotropic wind scattering
//OLD   02feb   ksl     41.1 -- Allowed user to chose between anisotropic and
//OLD                   isotropic scattering in the wind.
//OLD   02feb   ksl     41.2 -- Added aditional options for choosing what photons
//OLD                   to count
//OLD   02apr   ksl     43.1 -- Added additional radiative transfer options.  Modified main
//OLD                   so that a spectrum is printed out after each cycle
//OLD   02jul   ksl     43.7 -- Considerable changes associated with photoionization
//OLD                   and recombination were made.  The initial attemps to allow
//OLD                   for using a more accurate detailed balance approach were
//OLD                   included in the ionizatio routines.
//OLD   03dec   ksl     Added back some timing ability
//OLD         04Mar   SS      Minor changes to set switch for macro atom method.
//OLD                         geo.line_mode=6 switches geo.rt_mode=2 (macro method)
//OLD                         and then geo.ine_mode back to =3. (SS)
//OLD         04Apr   SS      Minor change to set a switch for geo.line_mode=7
//OLD                         which is the same as 6 but with anisotropic scattering
//OLD         04May   SS      geo.line_mode=8 added: this mode is the same as mode 6
//OLD                         BUT will treat all ions as simple - it is for
//OLD                         test purposes only.
//OLD   04Jun   ksl     Added new disk + wind model for ysos.  In process, moved
//OLD                   the variables describing the wind mdots to subroutines
//OLD   04Aug   ksl     52 -- Modified input variables to allow a variety of input models
//OLD                   all ascii-based.
//OLD   04Aug   ksl     52 -- Modified input variables to allow for various disk illumination
//OLD                   models
//OLD   04Aug   ksl     52 -- Modified to allow for vertically extended disks. Note that some of
//OLD                   the input variables were rearranged in the process.
//OLD         04Aug   SS      Minor modifications to cope with finite disk thickness calculations.
//OLD   04dec   ksl     54a -- Minor mod to calculation of fraction of luminosity that hits
//OLD                   disk so that correct values are printed out in situation where there
//OLD                   are multiple subcycles.
//OLD   04dec   ksl     54e -- Minor mod to record master atomic file in geo, and, for the
//OLD                   case of fixed concentration to store the file where the concentrations
//OLD                   are contaned.
//OLD   05apr   ksl     56 -- Added new variable geo.binary_system to avoid binary system
//OLD                   questions in cases where one was modelling a single object.  Note
//OLD                   that I did not remove seemingly superfluous quesions regarding
//OLD                   phase because one can still extract photons in various azimuthal
//OLD                   directions, and if we ever move to 3d situations one might want
//OLD                   to deal with non-axially symmetric systems.
//OLD   05jul   ksl     56d -- Updated to include new windcone definitions.
//OLD   05jul   ksl     56d -- Completed basic work to allow vertically extended disk
//OLD   06may   ksl     57g -- Began work on modifying structures to lower memory requirments
//OLD                   At empty wind cells have mostly been eliminated, and macroatoms
//OLD                   have been split off into a separate structure so this is not
//OLD                   used.
//OLD   06jul   ksl     57h -- Have contined work to speed program up as much as possible
//OLD                   by giving more control over the parameters that govern the speed
//OLD                   such as SMAX_FRAC.
//OLD   06oct   ksl     58 -- This version is a cleaned up version of py57ib, which differs
//OLD                   from 57h primarily in bb.c and pdf.c.   In addition, this version
//OLD                   makes it possible to use the SV velocity law in what is otherwise
//OLD                   a KWD description of the wind.
//OLD   06nov   ksl     58c -- This version requires and updated version of kpar, that
//OLD                   keeps track of all the errors.
//OLD   07aug   ksl     58f -- Modified the way in which the program handles a situation
//OLD                   in which one attempts to run with a non-existent .pf file.
//OLD   08may   ksl     60a -- Significant modifications were made to the main routine
//OLD                   to make sure we could restart models.  Unfortunaaely rhe point
//OLD                   at which the user was asked for the atomic data needed to be changed,
//OLD                   so earlier .pf files will need to be modified.
//OLD   080808  ksl     62 -- Cleaned up wind ionization options
//OLD   081110  ksl     67 -- Revised a number of portions of the main python.c routine
//OLD                   to enable restarts.  There are still inconsistencies in the
//OLD                   way one reads information from the .pf file after having read
//OLD                   in the windsave files that could be cleaned up.
//OLD   081218  ksl     67c -- Added a switch -h to provide information about usage.
//OLD   090202  ksl     68b -- Added switch -v  to control the level of verbosity.  Updated
//OLD                   Plasma to allow routine to track scatters and absorption during
//OLD                   generation of detailed spectrum
//OLD   090402  ksl     NSPEC has been moved to the main routine, as its only remaining
//OLD                   purpose is to define some arrays in the main routine.  Note that
//OLD                   MSPEC still has meaning as the number of spectra of various types
//OLD                   that are construced without going through types.
//OLD   1108    ksl/nsh Adding code to keep track of gross spectra in a cell though xbands,
//OLD                   xj and xave_freq.  Just set up the frequence limits here.
//OLD   1112    ksl     Moved everything associated with frequency bands into bands_init
//OLD   1212    nsh     changed the way DFUDGE is defined.
//OLD         1302      jm      74b5 introduced double precision variable for photon number for calling
//OLD                   define_phot. Fixes Bug JM130302 in photon weights. It has been suggested
//OLD                   that we should make NPHOT a long integer- at the moment I have not done
//OLD                   this and simply comverted to double before calling define_phot (otherwise
//OLD                   I believe rdint would have to be redone for long integers).
//OLD   1304    ksl     75 rewrote the fix above to use a long, instead of double.
//OLD                   This has plenty of range.  Notge that there is no need to make NPHOT
//OLD                   a long, as suggested above.  We do not expect it to exceed 2e9,
//OLD                   although some kind of error check might be reasonble.
//OLD   1306    ksl     Modified to allow a power law component to a stellar spectrum.  Made
//OLD                   some changes use DEF variables instead of numbers to make choices
//OLD   1307    jm      SS Parallelized Python in June 2013, for release 76a. I have now introduced
//OLD                   slightly altered reporting to allow more succinct reporting in parallel mode.
//OLD   1307    ksl     Removed the Thierry & Hubeny O-star models as an option from the code.
//OLD                   This was never tested, and never really used.  Knox no longer even has the
//OLD                   models.  Note that Stuart is replacing this with a homologous expansion
//OLD                   model
//OLD   1308    nsh     Added a call to generate rtheta wind cones - issue #41
//OLD   1309    nsh     Changed the loop around where disk parameters are read in - issue #44
//OLD   1309    nsh     Added commands to write out warning summary - relating to issue #47
//OLD           1312    nsh     Added a new parameter file command to turn off heating and cooling mechanisms
//OLD                   at the moment it only does adiabatc
//OLD                   Also some modifications to the parallel communiactions to deal with some new
//OLD                   plasma variabales, and the min and max frequency photons seen in bands.
//OLD   1409    ksl     Added new switch -d to enable use of a new Debug logging feature
//OLD   1411    JM removed photons per cycle in favour of NPHOT. subcycles are now eliminated
//OLD   1501    JM moved some parallelization stuff to subroutines in para_update.c
//OLD                   functions are communicate_estimators_para, communicate_matom_estimators_para,
//OLD                   and gather_spectra_para
//OLD   1502            Major reorganisation of input gathering and setup. See setup.c, #136 and #139
//OLD   1508    ksl     Instroduction of the concept of domains to handle the disk and wind as separate
//OLD                   domains

/**
 * @brief     The main routine for Python, which supervises the ingest of data defining a model, the initializtion
 * of the model, and actual run of the model, and writing the data to the disk
 *
 *
 * @param [in] int  argc   The number of command line arguments
 * @param [in] char *  argv[]   The command line arguments
 * @return     Always returns 0
 *
 * @details
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * The main routine of Python is fairly simple conceptually.  One gather the data, one allocates and intializes
 * all of the data structures, one runs the ionization cycles and one run the detalied spectral cycles.
 * The main ruoutin of Python supervises all of these things
 *
 * The main routine is complicated (mainly) due to the multiple ways a model can be run.
 *
 *  * A model can be run from scratch
 *  * A model can be contined from an earlier run (increasing only the number of ionization or spectral cycles)
 *  * A new model can be run beginning with an old windsave file (allowing various parameters of the radiation souces to be set differently
 *  from the old model)
 *
 *  Additionally, there is logic associated with the fact that different types of models require different data.  An AGN for example does
 *  not have (the possibility of) a secondary star.  Most of the inputs from Python come from a parameter file, but Python also has a robust
 *  set of command line switches (See parse_command_line).
 *
 *  Once all the inputs are obtained, the main routine calles routines to allocate data structures needed  to hold the model and to complete
 *  the intialization of both the data structues and various other variables.
 *
 *  The it runs the ionization cycles (See calculate_ionization );
 *
 *  Finally it runs the cycles that calulate the detailed spectra (See make_spectra);
