/**
 * @brief     The main routine for Python, which supervises the ingest of data defining a model, the initializtion
 * of the model, and actual run of the model, and writing the data to the disk
 *
 *
 * @param [in] int  argc   The number of command line arguments
 * @param [in] char *  argv[]   The command line arguments
 * @return     Always returns 0
 *
 * @details
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * The main routine of Python is fairly simple conceptually.  One gather the data, one allocates and intializes
 * all of the data structures, one runs the ionization cycles and one run the detalied spectral cycles.
 * The main ruoutin of Python supervises all of these things
 *
 * The main routine is complicated (mainly) due to the multiple ways a model can be run.
 *
 *  * A model can be run from scratch
 *  * A model can be contined from an earlier run (increasing only the number of ionization or spectral cycles)
 *  * A new model can be run beginning with an old windsave file (allowing various parameters of the radiation souces to be set differently
 *  from the old model)
 *
 *  Additionally, there is logic associated with the fact that different types of models require different data.  An AGN for example does
 *  not have (the possibility of) a secondary star.  Most of the inputs from Python come from a parameter file, but Python also has a robust
 *  set of command line switches (See parse_command_line).
 *
 *  Once all the inputs are obtained, the main routine calles routines to allocate data structures needed  to hold the model and to complete
 *  the intialization of both the data structues and various other variables.
 *
 *  The it runs the ionization cycles (See calculate_ionization );
 *
 *  Finally it runs the cycles that calulate the detailed spectra (See make_spectra);
 *
