 Synopsis:
	Python is a program designed to simulate the transfer of radiation in a wind.  It uses the
	Sobolev approximation.  It models a wind as a biconical flow.     
	
	This is the "main" routine for Python.  It's basic purpose is to gather the input variables 
	and to control the flow of the program
 
Arguments:		

	Usage:  py [-h] [-r] [-d] [-f] [-t time_max] xxx  or simply py

	where xxx is the rootname or full name of a parameter file, e. g. test.pf

	and the switches have the following meanings

	-h 	to get this help message
	-r 	restart a run of the progarm reading the file xxx.windsave

	-t time_max	limit the total time to approximately time_max seconds.  Note that the program checks
		for this limit somewhat infrequently, usually at the ends of cycles, because it
		is attempting to save the program outputs so that the program can be restarted with
		-r if theat is desired.
	-v num  determines the amount of information that is printed out.  If num is small, then
		less information is printed out; if num is large more is printed out.  Setting
		v to 5 causes the routine to print out all the information which outputs have
		included previously.  The current default is set to 3 which suppresses Debug, Log_silent
		and Error_silent
	-e nnn	The program stops normally stops after 1e6 errors of any type.  This switch allows one to
		adjust this number
	-d	Enters detailed or advanced mode. Allows one to access extra diagnositics and some
	    	other advanced commands
    -f  	Fixed temperature mode - does not attempt to change the temperature of cells.
	-i  	Diagnostic mode which quits after reading in inputs. Used for Travis test suite.
    --dry-run	Create a new .pf file and stop (equivalent to -i)
	-z  	Mode to connect with zeus - it either runs two cycles in this is the first call - in order
         	to obtain a good starting state, else it runs just one cycle. In both cases, it does
    		not attempt to seek a new temperature, but it does output heating and cooling rates
    --version	print out python version, commit hash and if there were files with uncommitted
	    	changes
      --rseed	set the random number seed to be time based, rather than fixed.

	
	if one simply types py or pyZZ where ZZ is the version number one is queried for a name
	of the parameter file.

	NOTE - If this is modified, please also modify the help message in help() below
Returns:
 
Description:	
	Python is far too complicated to describe.  Basically it simulates the radiative transfer
	of photons through the wind of a cataclysmic variable or a star.  The kinematic formulation for
	the CV wind is due to Schlossman and Vitello while that of the star is due to Castor & Larmors. 
	
	 Radiation from an optically thick disk, the WD star, a boundary layer and the wind itself
	 may be included
	
	There are 3 basic portions to the program which are easy to see in the main program.
	
	1. A data gathering stage
	
	2. A calculation of the state of ionization of the wind.
	
	3. A calculation of a detailed spectrum in which the ionization is held fixed.
	
		
Notes:
	The program has been designed and tested both on Suns and MacIntoshes (with Symentec's
	C compiler).  Some of its peculiarities are due to memory limitations and relatively small 
	stack sizes on the Mac.  When compiling, check to see that the global varible MAC is
	set properly in python.h.

History:
 	97jan   ksl	Coding on python began.
 	97jul	ksl	Added capability model the spectrum as a function of orbital phase.
 	97aug	ksl	Added boundary layer as additional source of radiation
 	97aug	ksl	Added capability to extract spectra with a specific number of scatters
 	97nov	ksl	Changed error and diagnostic logging
 	98july	ksl	Added radiation from the wind itself
 	98nov	ksl	Added spherical winds and greatly modified I/O  
	99jan	ksl	Added ability to enter parameter file (w/out) root on command line
	99jul	ksl	Begin eliminating MAC dependencies
	00sep	ksl	Began work on adding a new coronal possibility
	01mar	ksl	Added a knigge wind
        01sept	ksl	Added a thierry wind
	01dec	ksl	Incorporated improved atomic data reading codes, and
			made a variety of other major changes to the way in
			which many of the subroutines operate.
	01dec	ksl	Revised way in which old windfile option works.  It
			was not working at all originally, because of a
			change I made in April.  The new method is a bit dangerous
			because it does change a good bit of geo, since all of the
			input data is read in.  In principle, his can create an inconsistency
			between some of the info in geo and some in the wind array.
			But it keeps the wind the same, which is what was desired.  
	01dec	ksl	Added a general capability to python(40) so that during the
			the ionization cycle photons do not necessarily have identical
			weights.
	02jan	ksl	Moved specific inputs for KWD wind to knigge.c
	02feb	ksl	Added anisotropic wind scattering
	02feb	ksl	41.1 -- Allowed user to chose between anisotropic and
			isotropic scattering in the wind.
	02feb	ksl	41.2 -- Added aditional options for choosing what photons
			to count
	02apr	ksl	43.1 -- Added additional radiative transfer options.  Modified main
			so that a spectrum is printed out after each cycle
	02jul	ksl	43.7 -- Considerable changes associated with photoionization
			and recombination were made.  The initial attemps to allow
			for using a more accurate detailed balance approach were
			included in the ionizatio routines.
	03dec	ksl	Added back some timing ability
        04Mar   SS      Minor changes to set switch for macro atom method.
                        geo.line_mode=6 switches geo.rt_mode=2 (macro method)
                        and then geo.ine_mode back to =3. (SS)
        04Apr   SS      Minor change to set a switch for geo.line_mode=7 
                        which is the same as 6 but with anisotropic scattering
        04May   SS      geo.line_mode=8 added: this mode is the same as mode 6
                        BUT will treat all ions as simple - it is for 
                        test purposes only.
	04Jun	ksl	Added new disk + wind model for ysos.  In process, moved
			the variables describing the wind mdots to subroutines
	04Aug	ksl	52 -- Modified input variables to allow a variety of input models
			all ascii-based.
	04Aug	ksl	52 -- Modified input variables to allow for various disk illumination
			models
	04Aug	ksl	52 -- Modified to allow for vertically extended disks. Note that some of
			the input variables were rearranged in the process.
        04Aug   SS      Minor modifications to cope with finite disk thickness calculations.
	04dec	ksl	54a -- Minor mod to calculation of fraction of luminosity that hits
			disk so that correct values are printed out in situation where there
			are multiple subcycles.
	04dec	ksl	54e -- Minor mod to record master atomic file in geo, and, for the 
			case of fixed concentration to store the file where the concentrations
			are contaned.
	05apr	ksl	56 -- Added new variable geo.binary_system to avoid binary system
			questions in cases where one was modelling a single object.  Note
			that I did not remove seemingly superfluous quesions regarding
			phase because one can still extract photons in various azimuthal
			directions, and if we ever move to 3d situations one might want
			to deal with non-axially symmetric systems.
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Updated to include new windcone definitions.
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Completed basic work to allow vertically extended disk
	06may	ksl	57g -- Began work on modifying structures to lower memory requirments
			At empty wind cells have mostly been eliminated, and macroatoms
			have been split off into a separate structure so this is not 
			used.
	06jul	ksl	57h -- Have contined work to speed program up as much as possible
			by giving more control over the parameters that govern the speed
			such as SMAX_FRAC.
	06oct	ksl	58 -- This version is a cleaned up version of py57ib, which differs
			from 57h primarily in bb.c and pdf.c.   In addition, this version
			makes it possible to use the SV velocity law in what is otherwise
			a KWD description of the wind.  
	06nov	ksl	58c -- This version requires and updated version of kpar, that 
			keeps track of all the errors.  
	07aug	ksl	58f -- Modified the way in which the program handles a situation
			in which one attempts to run with a non-existent .pf file.
	08may	ksl	60a -- Significant modifications were made to the main routine
			to make sure we could restart models.  Unfortunaaely rhe point
			at which the user was asked for the atomic data needed to be changed,
			so earlier .pf files will need to be modified.  
	080808	ksl	62 -- Cleaned up wind ionization options
	081110	ksl	67 -- Revised a number of portions of the main python.c routine
			to enable restarts.  There are still inconsistencies in the
			way one reads information from the .pf file after having read
			in the windsave files that could be cleaned up.
	081218	ksl	67c -- Added a switch -h to provide information about usage.
	090202	ksl	68b -- Added switch -v  to control the level of verbosity.  Updated
			Plasma to allow routine to track scatters and absorption during
			generation of detailed spectrum
	090402	ksl	NSPEC has been moved to the main routine, as its only remaining
			purpose is to define some arrays in the main routine.  Note that
			MSPEC still has meaning as the number of spectra of various types
			that are construced without going through types.
	1108	ksl/nsh Adding code to keep track of gross spectra in a cell though xbands,
			xj and xave_freq.  Just set up the frequence limits here.	
	1112	ksl	Moved everything associated with frequency bands into bands_init
	1212	nsh	changed the way DFUDGE is defined.
        1302	jm	74b5 introduced double precision variable for photon number for calling 
			define_phot. Fixes Bug JM130302 in photon weights. It has been suggested
			that we should make NPHOT a long integer- at the moment I have not done 
			this and simply comverted to double before calling define_phot (otherwise 
			I believe rdint would have to be redone for long integers).
	1304	ksl	75 rewrote the fix above to use a long, instead of double.  
			This has plenty of range.  Notge that there is no need to make NPHOT
			a long, as suggested above.  We do not expect it to exceed 2e9,
			although some kind of error check might be reasonble.
	1306	ksl	Modified to allow a power law component to a stellar spectrum.  Made
			some changes use DEF variables instead of numbers to make choices
	1307	jm	SS Parallelized Python in June 2013, for release 76a. I have now introduced
			slightly altered reporting to allow more succinct reporting in parallel mode.
	1307	ksl	Removed the Thierry & Hubeny O-star models as an option from the code.
			This was never tested, and never really used.  Knox no longer even has the 
			models.  Note that Stuart is replacing this with a homologous expansion
			model
	1308	nsh	Added a call to generate rtheta wind cones - issue #41
	1309	nsh	Changed the loop around where disk parameters are read in - issue #44
	1309	nsh	Added commands to write out warning summary - relating to issue #47
  	1312	nsh	Added a new parameter file command to turn off heating and cooling mechanisms
			at the moment it only does adiabatc
			Also some modifications to the parallel communiactions to deal with some new
			plasma variabales, and the min and max frequency photons seen in bands.
	1409	ksl	Added new switch -d to enable use of a new Debug logging feature
	1411 	JM removed photons per cycle in favour of NPHOT. subcycles are now eliminated
	1501 	JM moved some parallelization stuff to subroutines in para_update.c
			functions are communicate_estimators_para, communicate_matom_estimators_para,
			and gather_spectra_para
	1502		Major reorganisation of input gathering and setup. See setup.c, #136 and #139
	1508	ksl	Instroduction of the concept of domains to handle the disk and wind as separate
			domains
