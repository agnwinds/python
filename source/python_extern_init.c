                                   distance of the photon from the origin.  This had been hardwired to
                                   0.1 for up to 57h.  Changing it to 0.5 speeds up the current version
                                   of the code by as much as a factor of 2 for small sized grids.  This
                                   had been introduced as part of the attempt to assure ourselves that
                                   line shapes were calculated as accurately as possible.  The underlhying
                                   rational for having a maximum disstance is associated with the fact that
                                   we use linear interpolation along the line of sight to establish velocities
                                   and most of our grid cells in 2.5d are actually hoop shaped, which means
                                   one can travel a long distance within a hoop if the direction of the photon
                                   is not more or less radial, but if moving along the hoop.
