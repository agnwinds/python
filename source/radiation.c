/**
 * @brief      updates the  field parameters in the wind and reduces
 * the weight of the photon as a result of the effects of  free free, bound-free and
 * Compton scattering. The routine
 * also keeps track of the number of photoionizations for H and He in the
 * cell.
 *
 * @param [in,out] PhotPtr  p   the photon
 * @param [in] double  ds   the distance the photon has travelled in the cell
 * @return     Usually regurns kappa_tot 
 *
 * @details
 *
 * The pieces of the wind structure which are updated in each call to radiation
 * are:
 *   j,ave_freq,ntot, heat_photo, heat_ff, heat_h, heat_he1, heat_he2, heat_z,
 *   nioniz, and ioniz[].
 *
 * @details
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * The # of ionizations of a specific ion = (w(0)-w(s))*n_i sigma_i/ (h nu * kappa_tot).  (The # of ionizations
 * is just given by the integral of n_i sigma_i w(s) / h nu ds, but if the density is assumed to
 * be constant and sigma is also constant [therefy ignoring velocity shifts in a grid cell], then
 * n_i sigma and h nu can be brought outside the integral.  Hence the integral is just over w(s),
 * but that is just given by (w(0)-w(smax))/kappa_tot.)  The routine calculates the number of ionizations per
 * unit volume.
 *
 * Inputs to radiation are assumed to be in the observer frame.  kappas are calculated
 * in the CMF frame, as elsewhere.  Where tau is calculted from kappa ds, one needs to
 * account for the difference in length in the two frames
