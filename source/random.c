   Notes: Routine was incorrect for a long time.  Fixed by ck  June 1998

   The current routine, as corrected by CK, creates a random vector
   in spherical coordinates, noting that an element of solid angle i
   s sin(theta) d(theta) d(phi).  But sin(theta)d(theta) is simply 
   -d(cos(theta)), and so a random vector is created by generating
   a random number between 0 and 2 PI representing phi and between
   -1 and 1 representing cos(phi).
