                                       Space Telescope Science Institute

 Synopsis:
 
This file contains various routines which implement a relatively straightforward
interface to get data either from the user or a command line.

The basic routines are as follows:
	rdstr(question,answer)	gets a single contiguous string 
	rdchar(question,answer)	gets a single character
	rdint(question,answer)	gets a single integer
	rdflo(question,answer)	gets a single precision floating point number
	rddoub(question,answer)	gets a double precision floating point number
	rdline(question,answer)	gets an entire line
	rdpar_comment(string)   Adds a comment to any output.pf files



The file also contains routines to control how rdpar operates:

opar(infilename)   --- allows one to read from a file instead of from the
	command line.  If opar is not called then interactive mode is 
	assumed.  If the filedoes not exist, the routines drop into interactive
	mode. 
cpar(outfilename)  ---- causes the temporary file being created by the various
	routines to be copied to outfilename.  If there was a file with
	that name previously it will be copied to filename.old.   If cpar
	is not called, then the datat which is aquired with the readpar
	routines will be found in "tmp.rdpar"
int get_root(root,total) -- strips off the trailing characters in a file
	name.
int rdpar_set_mpi_rank(rank) -- passes the rank of the parallel process to rdpar

The file also contains a little subroutine to put out a message of
one or more lines.

message(string)

Arguments:

	For the io routines the arguments are

	char question[];	The string printed to the screen to prompt the user
					or read from the file and matched
	*answer			The value returned; the type depends on the call.
		

Returns:
	The individual io routines return 
		1 or more for a successful read
		EOF if receive done or EOF 
 
Description:	
	
	In interactive mode, the programs print out the question and
	expects an answer.  Only one integer (or whatever) is read at a time.
	The calls are generally of the form
		rdxxx(question,whatever)
		char question[]
		whatevertype *whatever
	To keep the current value, respond with \n
	In interactive mode, type ^D to exit the program immedieately
	
	In noninteractive mode, the program reads a line of a file.  It uses
	the first uninterrupted string to assure itself that it has read the correct
	line of the file (it expects the first string to be the question)
	and then the second uninterrupted string as the value
	of answer.  (An exception is rdline in which case it returns the entire
	rest of the line).
	
	In noninteractive mode, if the second string in the file is "$" (or 
	there is no second string, it will
	ask the user that question interactively and then continue to read
	other answers from the file.  (Thus if one wants to run the program
	a bunch of times, changind only one or two of the values in the
	program, one can include most of the values in the file, but leave
	the values which will change as $)

	In noninteractive mode, if the string in the file and the string in the
	question do not match, it will read through the file until one does
	match or until it reaches the EOF in which case it will switch to 
	interactive mode and try that.


	When used as an interactive interface, this
	version generates a file which can be used to run the program again.  

	That file can be edited, but one needs to stick fairly closely to the file
	which is produced.  !!!!  	
		
Notes:

	The original rdpar was written at SAO for handling the reduction programs
	assocated with Einstein data.  C and Fortran versions of the code exist.
	The SAO version of rdpar always works from parameter (".pf" files".  
	When I began working with c programs on Macs (and Atari's), I wrote
	a set of routines which I called "irdpar" which were intended to provide
	a simple interactive version of rdpar, i.e. a very readable way to get
	single input values into a program.  Eventually, it became clear that I
	was writing programs that would benefit from a file i/o interface as
	well and so this version of rdpar has been written.  
	
	This version of rdpar does not have all of the advantages of the old
	rdpar.  It does allow one to use $ in file to switch to interactive mode
	for that particular input.  But this version of rdpar cannot read more 
	than one variable from a line.  Finally, unlike rdpar this routine expects 
	variables to be in the file in the prescribed manner.  It bails out
	if the variables are not in the prescibed order.
	
	Note that you can have extra lines in the input file.  These will simply
	be copied to the output file.  But if you are thinking of using several
	programs which have some of the same keywords, be sure to put them
	in the same order in both programs.  It is OK to have 
		key1
		newkey
		key2
	
	where newkey is used by the second program but not the first.  But
	it is not a good idea to look for key2 before key1 in the second program.
		
	
	If you are writing programs using rdpar, and you seem to be having
	problems with the inputs, the usual problem is that you did not pass
	a pointer to rdxxx.
	

History:
	96dec     ksl	Began work to modifiy old interactive version of rdpar 
 				("irdpar") to function as a simpler version of "rdpar". 
 				Coded and debugged as part of Monte and Python efforts.  
	97mar   ksl  	Modified to allow one to use $ to switch to interactive mode
				for one line.
	97apr  ksl  	Modified to cause rdpar to continue reading through a 
				file until it finds the correct question keyword.  
				Thus keywords can be skipped.  Note that it
                		does not read through the file multiple times as 
                		the original rdpar would.
	97aug	ksl	Made changes needed so that rdpar would operate on the
         			Mac in a directory other than the directory in which the
         			program had been compiled.  (If on the Mac,  then rdpar
         			must be compled with the routines in "mac_file" and MAC
         			should be set to !0.)
	98feb	ksl	Made changes so that extra lines and comments would all go
         			to output file.  
	99jul	ksl	Eliminated all calls to gets in favor of fgets.  Note that fgets
				handles \n differently than does gets.  Also added a routine
				get_root to strip off the trailing characters in a file name.
				Removed special commands so would work on MAC (with Symentec C).
				These commands had only to do with the way files were opened since
				MAC assumes files are local to the location of the program rather than
				the place where the program is being executed.  I have also added restart_pf
                                which is designed to allow one to read the file multiple times.  
				There are interactions between cpar and 
                                restart_par which still need to be worked out better.  At present cpar needs
				to come after restart_par.
	00dec	ksl	Found small problem in rdchar.  It would not read properly from a file.  
			Hopefully it still works in the interactive situation.
	02jun	ksl	Modified behavior so only compares the input string to the first (.  This is
			to help make it possible to add new options to programs without forcing one
			to recreate parameter files.  
	04may	ksl	Corrected a problem where the first word ended up to have length 0.
	05jan	ksl	Corrected a problem where the first word matches a desired variable, but there
			was no second variable.  The solution is to ask for the variable on the command
			line.
        06jul	ksl	Increased LINELEN to 256
	07may	ksl	Made changes to make robust on bluegill (MacOSX)
	09mar	ksl	Added a capability to record all of the accepted values and write them out
			in a specified format to an already open file.  The purpose of this was
			to allow me to record the rdpar information in an output file, e.g a spectrum
	13jul	jm	Modified so in parallel mode only print to screen if thread 0 when reading from
			pf file. Also will not print to screen in a certain verbosity setting.
	16sept	ksl	Split string and file processing into separate subroutines, and modified
			so that the rdpar file is read in.  At present, if all of the keywords are
			contained in the .pf file, they will be read even if they are in the wrong
			order.  A line will not be read multiple times.  Also it is now possible
			to add a comment to a rdpar output file.  The behavior of the routine is also
			changed in the sense that if a variable is missing from the .pf file, one
			will be asked for the value of this variable only, and then the program will
			go on parsing the .pf file. (Note - removed restart_par as it is no longer needed)
