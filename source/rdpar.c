 * @author ksl
 * @date   February, 2018
 *
 * @brief  A general purpose interface for obtaining input data from the command line 
 * and/or from a file
 *
 *  This file contains various routines which implement a relatively straightforward
 *  keyword-based interface to get data either from the user or a command line.
 *  
 *  The basic routines are as follows:
 *  	- rdstr(question,answer)	gets a single contiguous string 
 *  	- rdchar(question,answer)	gets a single character
 *  	- rdchoice(question,answer) gets one of a number of allowed string answers
 *  	- rdint(question,answer)	gets a single integer
 *  	- rdflo(question,answer)	gets a single precision floating point number
 *  	- rddoub(question,answer)	gets a double precision floating point number
 *  	- rdline(question,answer)	gets an entire line
 *  	- rdpar_comment(string)   Adds a comment to any output.pf files
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  The file also contains routines to control how rdpar operates:
 *  
 *  - opar(infilename)   --- allows one to read from a file instead of from the
 *  	command line.  If opar is not called then interactive mode is 
 *  	assumed.  If the file does not exist, the routines drop into interactive
 *  	mode. 
 *  - cpar(outfilename)  ---- causes the temporary file being created by the various
 *  	routines to be copied to outfilename.  If there was a file with
 *  	that name previously it will be copied to filename.old.   If cpar
 *  	is not called, then the datat which is aquired with the readpar
 *  	routines will be found in "tmp.rdpar"
 *  - int get_root(root,total) -- strips off the trailing characters in a .pf file
 *  	name.
 *  - int rdpar_set_mpi_rank(rank) -- passes the rank of the parallel process to rdpar
 *  - int rdpar_set_verbosity  -- Control how much diagnostic information is printed out
 *  
 *  The file also contains a subroutine to put out a message of
 *  one or more lines.
 *  
 *  message(string)
 *  
 *  Arguments:
 *  
 *  	For the io routines the arguments are
 *  
 *  	char question[];	The string printed to the screen to prompt the user
 *  					or read from the file and matched
 *  	*answer			The value returned; the type depends on the call.
 *  		
 *  
 *  Returns:
 *  	The individual io routines return 
 *  		1 or more for a successful read
 *  		EOF if it receives done or EOF 
 *   
 *  Description:	
 *  	
 *  	In interactive mode, the programs print out the question and
 *  	expects an answer.  Only one integer (or whatever) is read at a time.
 *  	The calls are generally of the form
 *  		- rdxxx(question,whatever)
 *  		- char question[]
 *  		- whatevertype *whatever
 *
 *  	One can answere in several ways:
 *  	-To provide a new value, enter it
 *  	-To keep the current value, respond with \n
 *  	-To issue a system level command, respond with ! and the command
 *  	-To exist the program entirely, type ^D
 *  	
 *  	In noninteractive mode, the program reads in a file into the input structure.  
 *  	As inputs are requested, it reads this structure  to match the requested
 *  	parameter to a line in the structure from which it gets the parameter value.
 *  	The keywords can be in any order but once a line has been used, it is not
 *  	reused.  There can be multiple lines with the same keyword, as for example
 *  	is the case in Python when one wants to extract spectra from multiple angles
 *  	
 *  	In noninteractive mode, if the second string in the file is "$" (or 
 *  	there is no second string, it will
 *  	ask the user that question interactively and then continue to read
 *  	other answers from the file.  (Thus if one wants to run the program
 *  	a bunch of times, changind only one or two of the values in the
 *  	program, one can include most of the values in the file, but leave
 *  	the values which will change as $)
 *  
 *  	In noninteractive mode, if there is no matching keyword, the routine will
 *  	switch to interactive mode for that keyword, and try to get the value of
 *  	the parameter from the user.  It will then switch back to nonintercative mode.
 *  	interactive mode and try that.
 *
 *  	Since keywords occaassionaly change their names, the rdpar routines have a
 *  	synonyms facility that makes it possible (at least for a time) to use 
 *  	old parameter files.
 *  
 *  	The routine keeps track of all of the input variables as they are entered
 *  	or modified, and when cpar is called and at various other times can write
 *  	the answers to a file, including a new .pf file, generally called rootname.out.pf.
 *
 *      The output files use current parameter file names.
 *
 *  		
 *  ###Notes###
 *  
 *  	The original rdpar was written at SAO for handling the reduction programs
 *  	assocated with Einstein data.  C and Fortran versions of the code exist.
 *  	The SAO version of rdpar always works from parameter (".pf" files".  
 *  	When I began working with c programs on Macs (and Atari's), I wrote
 *  	a set of routines which I called "irdpar" which were intended to provide
 *  	a simple interactive version of rdpar, i.e. a very readable way to get
 *  	single input values into a program.  Eventually, it became clear that I
 *  	was writing programs that would benefit from a file i/o interface as
 *  	well and so this version of rdpar has been written.  
 *  	
 *  	This version of rdpar does not have all of the advantages of the old
 *  	rdpar.  It does allow one to use $ in file to switch to interactive mode
 *  	for that particular input.  But this version of rdpar cannot read more 
 *  	than one variable from a line.  Finally, unlike rdpar this routine expects 
 *  	variables to be in the file in the prescribed manner.  It bails out
 *  	if the variables are not in the prescibed order.
 *  	
 *  	Note that you can have extra lines in the input file.  These will simply
 *  	be copied to the output file.  But if you are thinking of using several
 *  	programs which have some of the same keywords, be sure to put them
 *  	in the same order in both programs.  It is OK to have 
 *  		- key1
 *  		- newkey
 *  		- key2
 *  	
 *  	where newkey is used by the second program but not the first.  But
 *  	it is not a good idea to look for key2 before key1 in the second program.
 *  	
 *  	If you are writing programs using rdpar, and you seem to be having
 *  	problems with the inputs, the usual problem is that you did not pass
 *  	a pointer to rdxxx.

 * The integer that is returned is that in the string answers,  for example

 *
 * It gets the choice from the command line or the parameter file in the standard manner.  Unlike
 * most of the other routines in the package, this routine returns the integer value of the choice that was made.  
 * answer contains the string version of the answer.
 *
 * ###Programming Comment###
 *
 * For backward compatibility, if the user enters an integer rather than a string.  The integer is returned. No
 * error checking is done to see that the integer is one of the allowed choices.   A comment is written to the
 * whatever.out.pf file to indicate that one should change integers to strings as ultimately we plan to remove 
 * the code that provides backward compatibility.
 *
 * Very important:  in rdchoice, the string answer is changed. c is very picky about when a string can be updated.  One cannot
 * change a string that has simply been set to a fixed value,  e. g.
 *
 * char whatever="whatever"
 *
 * This is fixed in memory.  Instead, one nees to create an array with a certain length, e.g
 *
 * char answer[LINELENGTH];
 *
 * and use strcpy or some other routine to initialize it.  Then one can call rdchoice.
