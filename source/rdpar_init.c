 * that are potentially available are actually made available
 *
 * The routines are currently only used in connection with
 * choosing what type of spectra (bb, power law, etc) to be
 * used for different sources (e.g the disk, the central object).
 *
 * In principle, one could use the mechanisms here to make
 * sure that a rdchoice command was set up properly.

 * addional structures.

 * @brief   construct a string that contains the allowed set

 * @param  [in] char *question  A string containing the question
 * @param  [out] char *choices  The choices that correspond to the

*
 * @return Always returns 0
 * 
 *
 * @details     
 *
 * This routine is general, but was implemented specifically to deal
 * with spectral types, where the spectral choices for the disk may
 * be different from those for a BH as a central object.
 *
 * A typical question to be parsed will be of the form: 
 *
 * disk.spec_type(bb,models)
 *
 * wheres there are other types of spectra, power, brems, that 
 * Python can produce.
 *
 * This routine reads the quesion, and returns a string that
 * contains the numbers that correspond to the choices bb, and models
 *
 * Following this, rdchoice can be called with the allowed choices.
 *
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * This routine does not do any kind of minimum match.  The choices,
 * items within the parenthese must exactly match those in the
 * structure.
 *
 * Init_choices must have been called, prior to get_choices.   
 * If not, Python exits with an error.
