 * @brief  The routines in this file all have to do with
 * photoionization and/or
 * recombination rates and emissivities.
 *
 * ###Notes###
 *
 * These routines are quite complex representing a lot of work by
 * various of us over a long period of time, and it is not entirely
 * clear that they are quite what we want at present.  It would be
 * worthwhile to think about
 * their structure the next time we make consider adding a physical
 * process involving recombination.
 *
 * Some of the complication associated with these routines arises
 * from run time considerations which may no longer be very relevant
 * today with parallel processing etc.

 *
 * @details
 * Python typically calculates photons in frequency ranges (in order
 * to enable stratified sampling).  For this to work, one needs
 * freebound emissivities and cooling rates corresponding to these
 * freqency ranges.  Since we retrun to the same frequency ranges every cycle,
 * Python stores the necessary information in structures.
 *
 * This routine is responsible for populating these structures, so
 * that they can be accessed later via the routine get_fb.
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * The first time the routine is called, both recombination
 * rates and band-limited luminosities are calculated.  On
 * subsequent calls the routine checks to see whether it has
 * already calculated the band-limited freebound emissivities,
 * and if so returns without redoing the calculation.  However,
 * if a new frequency interval is provided, the new luminosities
 * are added to the free-bound structure.  To force a
 * re-initialization nfb must be set to 0.
 *
 * The routine allows for the possibility that there are more
 * frequency intervals than place to store data and will recylce
 * the structure if this occurs (indicating this with several error
 * messages).  This allows the program to proceed, but if this
 * happens often then the variable NFB in python.h should be increased.
