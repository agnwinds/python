  Synopsis:

The routines in this file all have to do with photoionization and 
recombination rates and emissivities.  

(Note -- These descriptions need to be cleaned up and checked at some point. 
Today 06jul27 -- I just reorganized things more sensibly, but this section
should describe all of the routines generically)

Calculate the free-bound emissivity of a cell.   This is the emissivity,
eg ne * ni *enu.  It includes the electron density

  Description:

This is the version of the program that used detailed balance to
calculate the emissivity.  The specific formulation implemented
is that described most clearly in Hazy, but that comes from
Brown and Matthews 1970.

ion_choice      0- (nions-1) causes fb to return the emissivity of
		a specific ion number, i.e. 0 will be h1, 2 will be
		he1, etc.   
		>=nions returns the total emissivity
		<0  returns the emissivity of all metals, under the
		assumption that H and He comprise the first five
		ions in the input array.
fb_choice	When an ion recombines there are three possible quantities
		of interest.
			0=the emissivity/per unit frequency of the plasma
			1=the heat lost from the electrons (that is the
				fraction of the emissivity that does not
				go into the binding energy of the level
				to which the electron+ion are recombining)
			2=the emissivity in photons/unit frequency
		0 should be used in calculations of the emission spectrum but
		1 and should be used in energy loss and gain  calculations), while
	        2 should be used in ion densities and levels
                                                                                                   
  Arguments:  
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
  Returns:
                                                                                                   
  Notes:
                                                                                                   

For reference here is  the freebound structures that can be used for both the
specific emissivity of a free-bound transition.  But the real structue is
in python.h

	#define NTEMPS        100             // The number of temperatures which are stored in each fbstruct
	#define NFB   10              // The maximum number of frequency intervals for which the fb emission is calculated

	struct fbstruc
	{
	  double f1, f2;
	  double emiss[NIONS][NTEMPS];
	}
	freebound[NFB];

	double xnrecomb[NIONS][NTEMPS];       // There is only one set of recombination coefficients
	double fb_t[NTEMPS];

                                                                                                   
  History:
	01oct	ksl	Began work
	01nov	ksl	Adapt to include Verland cross-sections as well.
	02jun	ksl	Modified so could be used to calculate emissivities in
			photons as well as energy.
	06jul	ksl	57h-Standardized the headers and notes.  I have not
			really checked that everything is up to date, just
			put it into a more readable format.
	12jul	nsh	73-Subroutine bad_t_rr coded to generate a total
			recombination rate from badnell type parameters
	14jan	nsh	77a - Added some checks into the integrals, to ensure
			we do not attempt to integrate over a range of 
			frequencies so large that the integrand is zero over
			an excessive range - hence causing QROMB to return
			an answer of zero.

  Notes:
	As written, in July02, the idea is that if the recombination coefficients
	have been calculated the program is going to return an interpolated
	coefficient, if not, it will calculate it from scratch.  (The later is 
	much slower if one has to do it a lot of times.

	???? Error -- There is definitely an error because the program does
	not support option 0, and this is needed for calculation of the
	relative numbers of photons by fb vs free free photons.  ksl 02jul

	of the plasma (not the potential energy available if everything recombined.

  Notes:
	57h -- This routine was a major time sync in python57g.  Most of the problem
	was ascociated with the generation of pdfs.  So the program now has a 
	rather multilayered approach to reducing the number of pdf generation
	steps that has to be done.  For a long time, we simply stored a pdf in
 	the pdf_fb array.  For python_57h, I created a new structure, photstoremain
	which parallels plasmamain and with allows one to store photons for future
	use.  
	
	It's possible the time for this routine to take could be reduced by storing
	more than one set of extra photons for different frequncy intervals, since
	our "banding" approach causes the frequencies to shift during the photon
	generation cycle.  Alternatively, it is possible that changing the order
	of photon generation could help.  But the approach adopted eliminate
	most of the problems with the routine, and so I have not pursued that.

  History:

	98oct	ksl	Removed upper limits on freqency to attempt to resolve problems with
			different frequency limits in total_fb and one_fb
	01oct	ksl	Completely rewritten for topbase x-sections
	06jul	ksl	57h -- Modified to speed the program up by checking whether
			there are free_bound frequencies that have been previsulsy
			calculated for this cell and this condition.  Also, added
			a section which creates and stores multiple photons for
			the same conditions.  This reduces very significantly
			the number of times one has to construct a pdf, which is
			the main time sink for the program

  Arguments:  

	ion_choice	Either the total emissivity or the emissivity for a specific
			ion is caculated depending on whether ion_choice=nions, or 
			a value less than the total number of ions
    fb_choice determines whether what is returned is the emissivity a specific frecuency 0
            the emissivity reduced by the ionization potential 1, or the number of photons per
            unit Hz

	02jul	ksl	Modified to reflect desire to make fb_xtopbase and fb_verner

	06may	ksl	57+ -- Switched to plasma structure since no volume
	06jul	ksl	57h -- Cleaned this routine up a bit, in part to avoid
			calling fb_verner_partial when it should not be called.

  Notes:
	The first time the routine is called, both recombination
	rates and band-limited luminosities are calculated.  On
	subsequent calls the routine checks to see whether it has
	already calculated the band-limited freebound emissivities, 
	and if so returns without redoing the calculation.  However, 
	if a new frequency interval is provided, the new luminosities
	are added to the free-bound structure.  To force a 
	re-initialization nfb must be set to 0.

  Notes:

  This routine is called by integ_fb.  It is not intended to be called

  It's unusual nature is determined by the need to use a modififed 
  Numerical Recipes routine for integration of fb over a frequency range 
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
  History:
	02jul	ksl	Modified to elimate need to include information about the cell.
			At this point integ_fb yields answers per electron and per ion.
			Moved DENSITY_PHOT_MIN test out of integ_fb
	02jul	ksl	In attempt to store the fb coefficiencts this function
			renamed.  It actually calculates the emissivities, and integ_fb
			has become a kind of steering routine that normally, e.g. often
			reads the freebound arrays.

  Notes:

  This routine is  virtual copy of xinteg_fb but dones inner shell integrations.

  This routine is called by integ_fb.  It is not intended to be called

  It's unusual nature is determined by the need to use a modififed 
  Numerical Recipes routine for integration of fb over a frequency range
