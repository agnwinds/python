 Synopsis:

	double calculate_ds(w,p,phot,tau_scat,tau,nres,smax,istat)
	calculates the distance a photon will travel within a single shell,

Arguments:

	WindPtr w			the ptr to the structure defining the wind
	PhotPtr p,phot;			the photon at the near and the far edge of the shell
	double tau_scat			the optical depth at which the photon will scatter
	double smax			the maximum distance the photon can travel in the cell

Returns:

Calculate returns the distance the photon travels as the main result of the routine.

It also returns   
	tau, the optical depth at the calculated distance, 
	nres the number of the resonance if there was one, or -1 if there was not a resonant
		scatter in the cell.  
	istat 0 if the photon did not scatter,  1 if it did scatter.
 
Description:	 

taking
into account the resonances that appear within that shell.  Any paramaters that depend explicitly on the
coordinate gridding, such as the maximum distance the photon can travel before hitting the edge of the
shell,  should be calculated outside of this routine.


Notes:

Calculate_ds does not modify the p or phot in any way!!  It is not
entirely obvious to me that this is a good plan, but that is the
way it is.

History:
 	97jan	ksl	Coded as part of python effort
	02mar	ksl	Made small changes intended to reduce the number
			of times dvwind_ds was called in attempt to speed
			up program. 
	02jun	ksl	Added additional changes to prevent some
			of the more time consuming calculations
			when possible
        04Mar   SS      Changes for including macro atom approach.
                        Photoionisation included as a process to remove
                        photon packets are specific points.
                        tau_es is optical depth per unit length for e- scattering
                        tau_bf is optical depth per unit length for bf processes
                        tau_cont is sum of tau_es and tau_bf
	04Apr	ksl	Moved from a formalism where bf transitions are identified
			by nlines+ncont to NLINES+ncont, since presumably the latter
			will be easier to remember when debugging different types
			of input files.
			Moved the calculation of bf_opacities and of the selection
			of which continuum process causes scattering to a separate
			subroutine.  My motivation here is to keep the logic of
			calculate_ds as similar as possible to old versions of
			the code.
         04Apr   SS     Added ff as a source of opacity. ff always leads to creating of
                        a k-packet.
                        Renamed the continuum things from tau to kap since this makes
                        more sense.
                        Changed call to kappa_bf so that it includes all the topbase
                        bfs and not just the macro atom ones.
         04May   SS     Modifications to allow the macro_simple option. (All ions treated as
                        "simple").
	06may	ksl	57+ -- To allow for plasma structure.  
	1409	ksl	Changes to accommodate clumping

Synopsis:
	kbf_need(one) computes and stores the set of bound-free processes which
        make significiant contributions to the opacity in a grid cell.


Arguments:

       w - a pointer to the wind
       fmin - the lowest frequency of interest to the calculation
       fmax - the highest frequency of interest to the calculations


Returns:
	For each cell, the routine determines what bf transitons are inportant
	and stores them in one->kbf_use[n].  The total number of such transitions
	is given in one->kbf_nuse.


Description:	 

      This routine is now called before a Monte Carlo calculation. It determines which 
      bf processes are worth considering during the calculation that follows. To do this
      is uses the edge position (must be inside, or close to, the spectral region of 
      interest) and the edge opacity (must be greater than a threshold value, currently
      10^-6.

      The need for the routine is just to prevent wasting time on unimportant bf
      transitions.  It is called (currently from resonate).


Notes:
	The dimensionalty of kbf_use is currently set to NTOP_PHOT, which is large enough
	to store evey transition if necessary.


History:
        04Nov   SS	work began
	04dec	ksl	54b-- Small modification.  There is no need to search in 2d, one d
			is fine, since vol for edge cells is zero
	06may	ksl	57 -- Began work to match to plama structure.  Uses vol but only
			to decide which cells to calculate for so I switched to summing
			over the plaama structure.

 Synopsis:

double sobolev(p,w,l,dvds)  calculates tau associated with a resonance, given the 
conditions in the wind and the direction of the photon.

It does not modify any of the variables that are passed to it, including for example
the photon.  

Arguments:

	PhotPtr p		p is a single photon, whose position is that of the resonanace
	WindPtr w		w is a WindPtr to the cell in which the photon resides; it is not 
				the whole array 
	struct lines *l	ptr to the transition  which has a resonance at this point
	double dvds	the velocity gradient in the direction of travel of the photon

Returns:

	The optical depth associated with a transition

Description:	 

In the sobolev approx  tau = PI e^2 / m_e c  * NL * f * lambda * 1 / (|dv/dx|) where dv/ds 
is the velocity gradient in the direction the photon is travelling.  This can be made slightly 
simpler by noting that lambda = freq / c and so  tau = PI e^w / m_e   

Notes:

	One worries that the Sobolev length, e.g delta lambda/lambda c/dvds might lead to 
	problems if it is too long, e.g. greater than the size of the system.  I have done tests 
	to see whether limiting the minimum dvds made much difference in generating knigge9b.  At
	very high values e.g. 3, it essentially makes the wind non scattering.  At values of
	10**-3 or less, it made no difference in the models I looked at.   02apr-ksl

History:

	00dec	ksl	Modified to account for population
			of lines, i.e. two_level_atom
	01dec	ksl	Modified to account for changed call to two_level_atom.  Note
			that the calling routine resonate interpolates the density
			of the ion in question, which accounts for the shuffling
			of densities.  Made it really work correctly 02jan

			density

 Synopsis:

	doppler(pin,pout,v,nres) calculate the doppler shift given the direction of the incoming 
	and outgoing photons and the local  velocity of the wind 

Arguments:

	PhotPtr pin,pout	the incoming and outgoing photon
	double v[];		the velocity of the wind where the scatter occurred
	int nres;			either the number of the scatter, or a nonresonant scatter
						if nres < 0

Returns:

	pout->freq is updated

Description:	 

	Given the incoming and the outgoing photon direction, 
	doppler calculates the outgoing frequency (to first order in beta).  
	There are two basic cases, depending on whether it was a resonant 
	or a nonresonant scatter.  

Notes:
	This is more obscure than I first thought because second order
	terms can matter.  So for example, if as originally (up through
	python_43.0) one tries to convert from the global frame to the
	local rest frame and back using the formulas
		freq2= freq1 * (1-v/c)
		freq3= freq2 * (1-v/c)
	One finds that freq3=freq1 (1-v**2/c**2)...which is not accurate
	enough.  Therfore if you want to use a first order calculation
	you have to say.
		freq2= freq1 * (1-v/c)
		freq3= fre12 / (1-v/c)
	Alternatively of course, you could use the special relativistic
	formulat of
		freq2=freq1 * (1-v/c)/sqrt(1-v/c**2)
	but maybe this is OK for now.

 Synopsis:

	int scatter(w,p,nres) determines a new direction and frequency for a photon 
	that scatters in the wind 

Arguments:

	WindPtr w
	PhotPtr p			the  photon of interest
	int nres;			either the number of the scatter, or a nonresonant scatter
						if nres < 0

Returns:

Description:	 

	The routine calculates a new direction and frequency for a photon in both the
	resonant and non-resonant cases.  In the frame of the wind, scattering is assumed
	to be isotropic.  

Notes:
	This is the routine that is called when a resonant scatter does occur.
	
	The equations for the frequency shifts are accurate only to first order in beta

	This routine should not move the photon at all, because other routines need to
	take this photon in differing directions, and if one moves it here they may
	encounter this resonance again

        04feb   SS      Substantially modified to incorporate Macro Atom
                        treatment
        04Mar   SS      Creating of k-packets following bf absn is now allowed.
        04Apr   SS      Modified to branch when simple ions are involved 
                        (i.e. those for which a full macro atom treatment is
                        not required)
                        Also ff is now included: nres = -2 flags ff which leads
                        to creating a k-packet always.
        04May   SS      Modifications to allow the macro_simple option (i.e. all
                        ions treated as "simple").
        04Jun   SS      Modifications so simplify the interation of macro atoms and
                        k-packets. This routine does not now access kpkt and matom 
                        directly but via macro_gov which supervises what the k-packets
                        and r-packets do. Hopefully this make the logic easier to follow.

        04Dec  SS     Added nnscat pointer to call so that the anisotropic thermal
                        scattering model would work as before for "simple" calculations.
