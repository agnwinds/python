 * These routines have to do with calculating where resonances are and
 * how strong they are.

 * ###Notes###
 * These routines should be made geometry independent and therefore

 * @brief     calculate the distance a photon can travel
 * within a single shell without scattering
 *
 * @param [in] WindPtr  w   the entire wind structure
 * @param [in] PhotPtr  p   A photon (bundle)
 * @param [in] double  tau_scat   the optical depth at which the photon
 *                          will scatter
 * @param [in,out] double *  tau   Initially the current optical depth for
 *                          the photon; finally the optical depth 
 *                          at the distance the photon can be
 *                          moved.
 * @param [out] int *  nres   the number of the resonance, -1 if it was electron 
 *                          scatttering, -2 if it was ff, -99 if the
 *                          distance is not limited by some kind of scatter.
 * @param [in] double  smax   the maximum distance the photon can
 *                          travel in the cell
 * @param [out] int *  istat   A flag indicating whether the
 *                          photon should scatter if it travels the distance estimated, 0 if no, TAU_SCAT if yes.
 * @return                  The distance the photon can travel
 *
 * calculate_ds finds the distance the photon can travel subject to a
 * number of conditions. The possibilites include: 
 * * reaching a distance where tau = tau_scat.
 * * reaching a maximum distance smax set set to ensure we do not cross into another cell, 
 *              or indeed to go so far that one is
 *              not sure that the velocity can be approximated as a linear function of
 *              distance.
 *
 * The routine returns the distance that the photon can travel in the observer frame subject to
 * these conditions and information about why the photon stopped there 
 *
 * @details
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * Calculate_ds does not modify the p in any way!!
 *
 * Any parameters that depend explicitly on the
 * coordinate gridding, such as the maximum distance the photon
 * can travel before hitting the edge of the
 * shell should be calculated outside of this routine.
