 * @date   January, 2018
 *
 * @brief      These routines are used to describe the Roche geometry and are intended to allow one
 *    to calculate whether a photon intersects the surface of the star
 *
 *
 * The important routines are
 *
 *    - binary_basics  which uses the masses of the primary and the secondary to calculate
 *    the position of various Lagrange points, etc, and the size of a pillbox
 *    which encloses the Roche lobe of the secondary.  It must be called before
 *    the other routines can be used!
 *
 *    - hit_secondary   determines whether a photon defined by p_roche will hit the secondary
 *    or not.  If it misses, hit_secondary returns 0, if it hits, the return is
 *    P_SEC (or hit secondary as contained in python.h).
 *
 * ###Notes###
 *
 * The secondary is located along the x, i.e. 0, axis
 *
 *    To utilize the routines you must stuff the photon of interest into the external photon "p_roche".
 *    This is necessary because the program makes use of two Numerical Recipes Routines rtsafe
 *    and golden to find zeroes and minima respectively.  Note that it is possible (likely) that these are
 *    not the very best choices of Numerical Recipes routines to use.  In particular it is possible that
 *    BRENT could replace both routines.
 *
 *    The routines adopt the same approach as in Keith Horne's routines dealing with the Roche
 *    geometry, that is a pillbox is defined around the secondary.  The radius of the pillbox is
 *    determined by the maximum size of the secondary perpendicular to the line of sight between
 *    the two stars.  One end of the pillbox is defined by the L1 point.  The other end of the pillbox
 *    is defined by the backside of the secondary.  One first tests to find out whether a photon
 *    intersects the pillbox, and then one checks more carefully to see whether the photon actually
 *    hits the secondary (using the intersections with the pillbox to define the limits of the careful
 *    search.

 *
 * @param [in] PhotPtr  p   The photon whose trajectory we wish to examine
 * @param [out] double *  smin   If the photon, hits the pillbox, this is how far the photon must travel to enter the pillbox
 * @param [out] double *  smax   If the photon, hits the pillbox, this is how far the photon must travel to exit the pillbox

 * pillbox returns VERY_BIG if the photon p has not intersected the pillbox.  It appears to return the distance
 * to the pillbox if the photon p hits the pillbox.  smin and smax contain the entrance and exit distances.  It
 * is not obvious that smin < smax.
 *
 * The purpose of this routine is to separate photons which may hit the Roche surface and those which certainly do not
 * by seeing if the photon avoids a pillbox surrounding the secondary.  If the photons does not enter the pillbox then
 * one dos not have to explore in detail whether the photon hits the Roche surrvace.
 *
 * If the photon does pass through the secondary, then the routine returns the distances of entry and exit which
 * are used to limit the range of root finding that then must take place.
 *
 * ###Notes###
 *
 * The pillbox is defined by a plane at L1, a plane on the backside of the star and a cylinder whose radius
 * is the maximum (half) width of the star in the plane of the orbit.
 *
 * This routine distinguishes two basic types of photons, "normal" and "abnormal" photons.  A normal photon
 * is on the WD side of L1 plane; an abnormal one is on the side of the L1 plane with the secondary.
 *
 * Note:   01jul22	ksl revised  this so that it would handle photons coming in all directions for use with plot_roche
 * but this instantiation of pillbox still seems to me not optical.  The basic point is that unless the photon
 * is in the pillbox, the only roots that matter are ones which are positive.  Only inside the pillbox will
 * there be a positive and a negative root.  Here we try to correct this at the end by making sure that both
 * roots are not negative, but one would have thought that one might establish that that photons inside the
 * pillbox are special and dealt with them accordindly
