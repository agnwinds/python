 * @date   January, 2018
 *
 * @brief      These routines are used to describe the Roche geometry and are intended to allow one
 *    to calculate whether a photon intersects the surface of the star
 *
 *
 * The important routines are
 *
 *    - binary_basics  which uses the masses of the primary and the secondary to calculate
 *    the position of various Lagrange points, etc, and the size of a pillbox
 *    which encloses the Roche lobe of the secondary.  It must be called before
 *    the other routines can be used!
 *
 *    - hit_secondary   determines whether a photon defined by p_roche will hit the secondary
 *    or not.  If it misses, hit_secondary returns 0, if it hits, the return is
 *    P_SEC (or hit secondary as contained in python.h).
 *
 * ###Notes###
 *
 * The secondary is located along the x, i.e. 0, axis
 *
 *    To utilize the routines you must stuff the photon of interest into the external photon "p_roche".
 *    This is necessary because the program makes use of the gsl-based routines find_rzero    
 *    and find_function_miniumum to find zeroes and minima respectively.  
 *
 *    The routines adopt the same approach as in Keith Horne's routines dealing with the Roche
 *    geometry, that is a pillbox is defined around the secondary.  The radius of the pillbox is
 *    determined by the maximum size of the secondary perpendicular to the line of sight between
 *    the two stars.  One end of the pillbox is defined by the L1 point.  The other end of the pillbox
 *    is defined by the backside of the secondary.  One first tests to find out whether a photon
 *    intersects the pillbox, and then one checks more carefully to see whether the photon actually
 *    hits the secondary (using the intersections with the pillbox to define the limits of the careful
 *    search.
