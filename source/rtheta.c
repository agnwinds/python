Arguments:		
	WindPtr w;	The structure which defines the wind in Python
 
Returns:
 
Description:

	In the implementation of cylindrical coordinates, we have defined
	the wind so that as (n = i * MDIM + j) is incremented, the positions 
	move in the z direction and then in the x direction, so that that 
	[i][j] correspond to the x, z position of the cell.

	For spherical polar, components we have defined the grid so that
	i corresponds to a radial distance, and j corresponds to an angle,
	e.g r theta.  increasing i corresponds to increasing distance,
	and increasing theta corresponds to increasing angle measured from
	the z axis. (This it should be fairly easy to implement true 
	spherical coordinates in the future.

	For now, we will assume that logarithmic intervals only affect the
	radial direction and do not affect theta.  It is not obvious that
	is what you want, and it is also not obvious that when you have 
	a vertically extended disk that theta should go over the full 90
	degrees.

     on ne so this is not necessary.  If we did do that it would be required.

     In cylindrical coordinates, the fast dimension is z; grid positions increase up in z, and then out in r.
     In spperical polar coordinates, the fast dimension is theta; the grid increases in theta (measured)
     from the z axis), and then in r.
