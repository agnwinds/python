 Synopsis:
	init_geo initializes the geo structure to something that is semi-reasonable
Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	
	Initial values for all of the variables that are not part of the individual
	wind descriptions that are actully read(!) into the program should be 
	created here.  The derived values are not needed.

		
Notes:

	When initializing geo, be sure to initialize to cgs units, since this cgs units
	are the working units for the program.  This is necessary for consistncy when
	one tries to restart the program.

	Note that init_geo is set up for CVs and Stars and not AGN

	XXX init_geo ought to be particularized for the system type.


History:
 	98dec	ksl	Coded and debugged.  Much of code was copied from old main routine for
			python
	04dec	ksl	This is probably still not completely up to date, but have
			added some initializations 
	080518	ksl	60a - modified to set all spectypes to SPECTYPE_BB, as part of 
			effort to get restarting models to work better
	080518	ksl	60a - modified all inputs to be in cgs units.  Added a small
      			amount of code to initialize model_list	
	081112	ksl	67 - moved more of initializaiton of geo into
			this routine as part of genearl cleanup of the main
			routine
	1508	ksl	A number of changes have been made in order to accommodate
			domains

	Generalized routine to get the spectrum type and read the model files 
Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	

		
Notes:

	The routine is slightly dangerous in the sense that if assumes that
	rdint always wants 0 for BB, models for 1, and 2 for uniform.  If
	we were to add another internally generated spectrum type one would
	have to carefull consider how to do this.  

	For models we have to handle two cases:
		A new model.  Here we want to start with a default value and
			to keep track of what was entered since it is likely
			we will want that together
		The continuation of an old model.  Here we need to expect the
			same choices as previously
081026 - Actual routine is still a mess.  
		* yesno is a statment of whether the component exists
		* question is really tightly associted with the way the program is 
		written
		* The progam returns the component type two ways, on through the call
		* and the other through the return.  It ssems like one would do.:

History:
	080518	ksl	Coded as part of effort to make models restart more
			easily, but also simplifies some of the code
        121025  nsh	added a mode for power law
