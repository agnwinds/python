	init_geo initializes the geo structure to something that is semi-reasonable
Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	
	Initial values for all of the variables that are not part of the individual
	wind descriptions that are actully read(!) into the program should be 
	created here.  The derived values are not needed.

		
Notes:

	When initializing geo, be sure to initialize to cgs units, since this cgs units
	are the working units for the program.  This is necessary for consistncy when
	one tries to restart the program.

	Note that init_geo is set up for CVs and Stars and not AGN

	XXX init_geo ought to be particularized for the system type.

	080518	ksl	60a - modified to set all spectypes to SPECTYPE_BB, as part of 
			effort to get restarting models to work better
	080518	ksl	60a - modified all inputs to be in cgs units.  Added a small
      			amount of code to initialize model_list	
	081112	ksl	67 - moved more of initializaiton of geo into

 Synopsis:
	Generalized routine to get the spectrum type and read the model files 
Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	

		
Notes:

	The routine is slightly dangerous in the sense that if assumes that
	rdint always wants 0 for BB, models for 1, and 2 for uniform.  If
	we were to add another internally generated spectrum type one would
	have to carefull consider how to do this.  

	For models we have to handle two cases:
		A new model.  Here we want to start with a default value and
			to keep track of what was entered since it is likely
			we will want that together
		The continuation of an old model.  Here we need to expect the
			same choices as previously
081026 - Actual routine is still a mess.  
		* yesno is a statment of whether the component exists
		* question is really tightly associted with the way the program is 
		written
		* The progam returns the component type two ways, on through the call
		* and the other through the return.  It ssems like one would do.:

 Synopsis:
	The next couple of routines are for recording information about photons/energy impinging
	on the disk, which is stored in a disk structure called qdisk.

	qdisk_init() just initializes the structure (once the disk structue has been initialized.

	qdisk_save records the results in a file

Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	

		
Notes:

	The reason the qdisk is needed as well as disk structure is that whenever the
	wavelength bands are changed the radii in the disk structure are recalibratied.
	We want qdisk to have fixed boundaries when this happens.

	04dec	ksl	created variable ztot so fractional heating

	080519	ksl	60a - Added code to calculate the irradiation of the disk
			in terms of t and w.  This should help to monitor the effect
