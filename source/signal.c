 * @brief  Routines indicating  how  many ionization or spectal
 * generation cycles have been completed in 
 * in a file named root.sig where 
 * root is the rootname of the .pf file and which stop the
 * program if one has set a maximum execution time and this
 * has been exceeded. 
 *
 * The purpose of these routines are to give a very high level
 * view of where the program is at any time, and in particular
 * whether the program was complete at the time the program exited.
 *
 * The were written for running models on systems whre there 
 * are time limits on how long a program can run, such as 
 * beowulf clusters.  
 *
 * They permit you to stop (checkpoint) 
 * the program after a certain time, and then using scripts
 * to easily determine whether the program ran to completion
 * and if not
 * to restart the program to finish a run

 *
 * Generally speaking one should send a message to xsignal before

 *
 * Bug #518:
 * Previously Python would, on occasion, deadlock when calling this function.
 * This was due to some MPI processes exceeding max_time whilst others did not,
 * resulting in some processes not exiting and continuing on with their work.
 * They would then try to communicate with other processes which have already
 * exited, get no response and then Python would deadlock. To avoid this happening,
 * EP added an MPI_Allreduce operation to find return the largest execution time
 * for a thread. This is then used to check if time > max_time, and if so then
 * MPI is finalised and Python will exit.
