 Synopsis:
 	The routines in this file are all associated with the process of
	modelling the spectrum in a cell. It uses the mean frequency to
	find a power law model and an exponential model. It then uses
	the standard deviation to decide which is best.

	The main routine is spectral_estimators and it currently attempts
	to model the spectrum in each band in the cell an exponetial or
	a power law.  The routine is called from ionization.c

	The results are stored in parameters in the PlasmaPtr structure 
	in variables, such as spec_mod_type, pl_alpah, pl_log,exp_temp, etc.

Notes:

History:
	111126	ksl	This was originally coded by nsh, but it
			was inserted directly into what was intended
			to be the steering routine for all ionization
			calculations.  I have moved it to its own
			routine in python_71
	111227	ksl	Eliminated n as an external variable
			because it really is not one
	111229	ksl	Small modifications made to reflect moving
			nxfreq and xfreq into the geo structure
        120802  nsh	Recoded so all this does is compute the estimators
			this is needed for other PL modes.
        120817  nsh     Changed many things to allow for an exponential model
			to be produced. Changed name of code to spec_estimators
			and changed file it is stored in to spectral_estimators.c
	130729	nsh	Changed some sane checks that were generating hugh numbers 
			errors, when they were just checking for reasonbleness.
			Also, changed the way the code deals with no photons in	
			band. Now only an error if we actually generate photons there!
	130907	nsh	Changed two errors into warnings - no photons in band is
			not really an error - it is perfectly reasonable so we
			really dont want the code to stop if it happens too often.
			However, we do want to know about it!
	131107	nsh	Some significant changes to the spectral models. The PL
			model was changed to work in log space, so it can now cope
			with very large exponenets, which means we can model much
			more extreme edges. Also, observed upper and lower limits
			have been implemented - so the spectral models are only
			applied where photon have actually been seen. Finally,
			the EXP model has been changed to allow positive exponents, 
			and also a check has been included to avoid T becomming 
			too small for a given (high) frequency, and hence returning 0, which
			gave inf errors. All these changes should mean that we no 
l			longer discard models on the basis of numerical limitations,
			so some of the log_silents have been replaced by 
			warnings so I can see if we do still get numberical problems.

 Synopsis:
 	integrand used with zbrent to calulate alpha from
	a mean frequency and a minimum and maximum frequecy
	for a band
        The function is the integral of nu j(nu) divided by the integral of j(nu).
	The prefector w is lost in the division, so this function should equal the
	mean frequency. Zbrent searches for the value of alpha which makes this
	function equal to the mean frequency computed for the cell from photon 
	packets. So we subtract the mean frequency at the end to make the value of the
	function equal to zero at the correct alpha.

	This program works out the standard deviation of a photon distribution modelled

 Synopsis:
 	integrand used with zbrent to calulate effective temperature for an
	exponential model from a mean frequency and a minimum and maximum frequecy
	for a band
        The mean is the integral of nu j(nu) divided by the integral of j(nu).
	The prefector w is lost in the division, so this function should equal the
	mean frequency. Zbrent searches for the value of 'temperature' which makes this
	function equal to the mean frequency computed for the cell from photon 
	packets. So we subtract the mean frequency at the end to make the value of the
	function equal to zero at the correct temperature.

	is very simple, just works out the difference between the computed mean, and the measured
