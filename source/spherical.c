/* Notes on spherical coordinates

   In spherical coordinates, we set NDIM = to whatever and MDIM = 1.  

   Some of the variables in the Wind_ptr array, like the divergence
   have to be calculated at a certain place.  Logically, one would
   do this along one of the principle axes.  But at present I have
   calculted this along a 45 degree angle.  The reason I did this
   was because I want the code to run for normal bipolar winds.  But
   this can be an issue for anisotropic scattering!!  It should not
   affect items like the divergence, but it certainly affects the
   gradients.

	the fast dimension is theta; the grid increases in theta (measured) from 
	the z axis), and then in r.  In spherical coordinates,
