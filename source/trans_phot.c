 Synopsis:
 int trans_phot(w,p,iextract) oversees the propagation of a "flight" of photons
Arguments:		
	PhotPtr p;
	WindPtr w;
	int iextract	0  -> the live or die option and therefore no need to call extract 
                       !0  -> the normal option for python and hence the need to call "extract"
 
Returns:
  
Description:	
This routine oversees the propagation of  individual photons.  The main loop 
covers an entire "flight" of photons.   The routine generates the random
optical depth a photon can travel before scattering and monitors the
progress of the photon through the grid.  The real physics is done else
where, in "translate" or "scatter".
		
Notes:
History:
 	97jan	ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort.  
 	98mar	ksl	Modified to allow for photons which are created in the wind
	00nov	ksl	Cleaned up some of the logic when a photon was scattered
			and assured that photon did not continue when pure absorption
			was used.
	01aug	ksl	Modified Error messages (and made silent) when a photon was
			detected out of the cell in which it was originally.  This
			is a possible outcome (because a photon moves as far as the
			boundary + DFUDGE, but if this happens a lot one should worry.
	01dec	ksl	Modified calls to extract to use .origin where possible
			and to change meaning of itype in extract to conform	
			to that of origin.  This mainly just separates star + bl
			into individual sources.
	02jan	ksl	Added line to assure that trans_phot returns the final weight of
			all photons, even though the position may be the position of
			last scatter, or in the absence of scatters the originating 
			position of the photon.  This was to assure that photoabsorption
			and other pure absorption processes, are properly incoporated
			into the global spectrum and in live or die option.
	04mar	ksl	Made small modifications (qdisk) to reflect fact that heating
			of disk is now stored in a separate structure.
        04Jun   SS      Small modification to kill photons when necessary during the 
                        spectral cycles of macro atom runs.
	1112	ksl	Made some changes in the logic to try to trap photons that
			had somehow escaped the wind to correct a segmenation fault
			that cropped up in spherical wind models
