 * @date   April, 2018
 *
 * @brief  This file contains high level routines which carry
 * out the propagation of photons through the wind/wind domains
 * both for ionization and spectrum (extract) cycles
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * The routines contained here are central to Python, and anyone
 * who wants to understand Python in general should spend time
 * understanding how they work
 *
 * There are two basic options associated with the routines.
 *
 * * live or die is the case in which one is only concerned
 * with how a photon goes through the wind and random numbers
 * are used to generate the scattering directions.  The photon is
 * followed until it leaves the system.  This is the only option
 * used in ionization cycles (currently).
 *
 * * extract is the mode where whenever a photon scatters we
 * also calculate what the photon weight would be if it scattered
 * in a set of certain directions.  When this happens the weight
 * of the photon is changed to reflect the fact that the direction
 * is not random.
 *
 * The extract option is used
 * normaly during the spectral extraction cycles.
 * However, as an advanced option one can use the live or die
 * to construct the detailed spectrum.  One would not normally
 * want to do this, as many photons are "wasted" since they
 * don't scatter at the desired angle.  With sufficient numbers
 * of photons however the results of the two methods should
 * (by construction) be identical (or at least very very
 * similar).

 * @param [in] WindPtr  w   The entire wind domain
 * @param [in, out] PhotPtr  p   A pointer to a "fligh" of photons
 * @param [in] int  iextract   An integer controlling whether we are to process the

 * @details
 * This routine oversees the propagation of  individual photons.  The main loop
 * covers an entire "flight" of photons.   The routine generates the random
 * optical depth a photon can travel before scattering and monitors the
 * progress of the photon through the grid.
 *
 * The real physics is done elsewhere, in lower level routines.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * At the end of the routine the position for each of the photons in p is the
 * last point where the photon was in the wind, * not the outer boundary of
 * the radiative transfer

 * @brief      Transport a single photon photon through the wind.
 *
 * @param [in] WindPtr  w   The entire wind
 * @param [in, out] PhotPtr  p   A single photon
 * @param [in] int  iextract   If 0, then process this photon in the live or die option, without
 * calling extract
 *
 * @return     Always returns 0
 *
 * @details
 * This routine oversees the propagation of an individual photon through
 * the wind.  As the photon moves through the wind, its position, direction
 * and weight are updated.  In reverberation mode, the flight time is also
 * tracked.
 *
 * Basically what the routine does is generate a random number whihc is used to
 * determine the optical depth to a scatter, and then it calles translate
 * multiple times.   translate involves moving the photon only a single cell
 * (or alternatively a single tranfer in the windless region), and returns
 * a status.  Depending on what this status is, trans_phot_single calls
 * trans_phot again doing nothing, but if the scattering depth has been
 * reached, then trans_phot_single causes the photon to scatter,
 * which changes its direction.  This process continues until the photon
 * exits the system or hits a barrier.  If the photon hits a radiating
 * surface, the disk or star, then the photon may either be absorbed,
 * or scattered depending on the reflection/absorption mode.
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * This routine is called by trans_phot once for each photon in a flight of photons
