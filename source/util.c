/* 
This routine is intended to locate the array element that is just below the
value of x and give one the appropriate "fraction" for interpolation between
array elements.  The idea behind this is that one wants to predict the velocity
at a position x and one has a structure tha contains the velocities at specific
values of x

The array "array" must be monotonically increasing and have dimension
xdim (with array elements 0 to xdim filled.  

The program returns 0 if the desired x is contained in the array, -1
if x is below the value of the first element and -2 if the element is above
the highest element.  

the array element in question and the fractional position 
for interpolation 
*/




/* fraction is a utility to speed up the search for the bracketing
topbase photionization x-sections, but in principle it should work in
other situations within python 

Returns: 0 is the value asked for was within the bounds of the array,
	-1 if below the lower bound, +1 if above the lower bound

	Assuming the value asked for is within the domain, then the 
	elment at the bottom of the bracketing interval and the fractional
	"distance" to the next element of the array are returned as 
	ival and f respectively
     	

Notes:  The routine is similar (I found aut afterward) to the numerical
	recipes routine locate.  It is possible there should be a separate
	routine locate to avoid the division at the bottom.

	This approach may not be ideal for many applications, especially
	those in which we have a good idea of where in the array
	the new value is located.

History:
	01dec	ksl	Added limits. fraction now produces an error
			if the value is out of range.  It also now
			assumes that it should return the limits when 
			a value is out of range.
	01dec	ksl	Changed calls so that fraction returns 0 if
			OK, -1 if the point is below the limit
			1 if it is above the maximum.  Since in many
			cases you don't care that you are asking for
			things out of range, I've suppressed the errors
			after the first 10.
	02feb	ksl	Modified slightly.  Note that this routine is
			a substantial fraction of time it takes to
			run python and it needs to be absolutely as
			efficient as possible.

Synopsis:  coord_fraction() is used to calculate the fractional 
	contributions in interpolations of values of quantities,
	such as electron density, by various cells in the 
	grid in a coordinate system independent way. 



Description:	 
	ichoice=0 --> interpolate on vertices
	ichoice=1 --> interpolate on centers

	x --> the 3-vector position for which you want
		the fractinal position
Returns:
	ii[] --> an array that contains the 1-d element
		numbers that must be summed  
	frac[] --> the array that contains the fractional
		contribution of the corresponding 
		element
	nelem --> the number of elements that must be
		summed, nominally 2 for a spherical grid
		and 4 for a two dimensional grid.  (For
		a 3 d grid it would be 6, but we have not
		implemented this.

	 1 if  inside the grid
	-2 if outside the grid
	-1 if inside the grid

Notes:
	There are numerous times when one wants the value
	of an interpoalted  variable in the wind.  There
	is no easy way to interpolate the variable easily.
	What this routine does is calculate the fractional
	contributions of elements in the array to that
	position.  Then one must sum up the actual variable
	else where

	If positions are outside the grid, coord_fraction
	attempts to give you the value at the edge of teh
	grid.

	It's possible that coord_fraction could be used 
	to interpolate beyond the edge of the grid where
	a variable is defined, although this is not done
	at present!

History:
	04aug	ksl	52a -- Coded as a generic routine
			to get the location in the grid
			and the fractions that can be
			used for interpolation
	04dec	ksl	54a -- Minor mod to exit if don't
			understand coord type
	05apr	ksl	55d -- Made a significant change
			to the way coord_fraction works
			to concentrate variations due to different
			coordinate systems here. Note that the
			variables for coord_fraction were changed
			significantly
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Modified so that for cylvar coords
			one simple calls the a special routine
			which is in cylindvar.c.  PROBABLY THIS ROUTINE
			SHOULD BE REWRITTEN SO THIS IS THE CASE
			FOR ALL COORDINATE SYSTEMS.
	13sep	nsh	76b -- Modified calls to fraction to take
			account of new mode.
	15aug	ksl	Modified to handle multiple domains.  This
			routine could yield errors if we are asked
			for positions outside one of the active 
			wind regions, so for now it finds the 
			domain, and prints and error if not
			in any domain.  Ultimately added the domain
			to one of the input variables because 
			there are times when we want coordinates
			which are outside the wind region.

Synopsis: wind_n_to_ij(ndom, n,i,j) and wind_ij_to_n(i,j,n) are two 
routines which effectively translate between the one dimensional 
wind structure and the two dimensional physical grid 

Arguments: 

the element in the wind structure i,j the position in the 
two dimensional grid

Returns:

i,j position in a given domain

Description:

Notes:

For 2d, the underlying 1-d grid is organized so that as n increases, 
one goes up in z, and then steps out in rho., or in theta and then
z as the case may be.

With domains, this routine has to be used carefully, and a better
statement would be that these routines map to and from the element 
in wmain to the normally 2d element in an individual domain.

So this means that if you want to get the ith and jth element of
domain 1, then one needs to give nstart+whatever to wind_n_to_ij
