  Synopsis:   

int
variable_temperature (xplasama, mode)  modifies the densities of ions, levels, and
	partition functions of ions within a cell of the wind based upon the mode, 
	and other data contained within the WindPtr itself, such as t_r, t_e, w, 
	based on the "mode".  

        Unlike nebular_concentrations, this code works on pairs of ions at a time, 
	and uses a temperature calculated to be suitable for that particular pair
	to have a ratio of abundances about equal to 1.
  
  Arguments:		
     PlasmaPtr ww;
     int mode;			// 6=correct using a dilute blackbody
     				   7=correct using a broken power law spectrum


  Returns:
 	variable temperature alters portions of the wind ptr.  Exactly how things 
	are changed depends on the mode.
 
 	variable_temperature returns 0 if it converged to an answer, -1 otherwise.  On an
 	abnormal return the density array and ne are left unchanged.
 	
  Description:	


 
  Notes:

  Section 5.3 of Nick's thesis explains the undelying ratinale for the so-called 
  variable temperature models.  The name of the routine is misleading since 
  there correctios are made for both a dilute power law and for a dilute bb. 



  History:
	2012Feb	nsh	Coded and debugged as part of QSO effort. 
        1212Dec nsh	Recoded so that the densities are computed in a 
			temporary array, and only 
			committted to the real density structure once 
			we are sure the code converges.
	2013Sep nsh	ground state fudge computed at the start, and 
			stored in an array rather
			than contiunually recomputing it - sometimes it is expensive.

  Synopsis:   
	pi_correct(xtemp,nion,xplasma,mode) calculates the photoionization rate
 	correction factor for the number density of two adjacent levels calculated
	at any temperature. LM is a special case of this where the temperatures
	are the same. Prior to Aug14, this was two routines bb_correct_2 and 
	pl_correct_2. Removing the calculations of the PI rates to a seperate
	routine have allowed the two routines to be combined into 1.
 
  Arguments:		

	double xtemp		the temperature at which the saha abundances were calculated
	int nion;		number of the upper ion in the pair for which the correction factor is
				being calculated.
	PlasmaStr xplasma	The cell currnently under test - this supplied the code with
				the parameters of the radiation field in the cell
	int mode		This is the ionization mode - 6 means we model the specific intensity
				as a dilute blackbody, 7 means it is modelled as a set of power laws
				or exponentials

  Returns:
 	j			the correction factor

  	14aug	NSH	Code to calculate the PI rate coefficient removed to new subroutine calc_pi_rate
