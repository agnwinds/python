  Synopsis:   

int
variable_temperature (xplasama, mode)  modifies the densities of ions, levels, and
	partition functions of ions within a cell of the wind based upon the mode, 
	and other data contained within the WindPtr itself, such as t_r, t_e, w, 
	based on the "mode".  

        Unlike nebular_concentrations, this code works on pairs of ions at a time, 
	and uses a temperature calculated to be suitable for that particular pair
	to have a ratio of abundances about equal to 1.
  
  Arguments:		
     PlasmaPtr ww;
     int mode;			// 6=correct using a dilute blackbody
     				   7=correct using a broken power law spectrum


  Returns:
 	variable temperature alters portions of the wind ptr.  Exactly how things 
	are changed depends on the mode.
 
 	variable_temperature returns 0 if it converged to an answer, -1 otherwise.  On an
 	abnormal return the density array and ne are left unchanged.
 	
  Description:	


 
  Notes:

  Section 5.3 of Nick's thesis explains the undelying ratinale for the so-called 
  variable temperature models.  The name of the routine is misleading since 
  there correctios are made for both a dilute power law and for a dilute bb. 



  History:
	2012Feb	nsh	Coded and debugged as part of QSO effort. 
        1212Dec nsh	Recoded so that the densities are computed in a 
			temporary array, and only 
			committted to the real density structure once 
			we are sure the code converges.
	2013Sep nsh	ground state fudge computed at the start, and 
			stored in an array rather
			than contiunually recomputing it - sometimes it is expensive.
