 * @brief      initializes the structures which characterize the wind, including
 * wmain and plasmamain.
 *
 * @return     Allways returns 0
 *
 * @details
 * This is the controlling routine for initializing the wind and related structures, calculating the
 * salient properties (e.g. the volume that is in the wind) in each grid cell.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * This is a fairly complex routine.  In addition ot allocating space, the routine initalizes
 * the wind.  In some case the initalization is done "in-line" but more often other routines,
 * many of which coordinate system specifica are clled.

 * @brief      finds the velocity vector v for the wind in cartesian

 * @param [in] PhotPtr  p   A photon

 * @return     0 	on successful completion, or a negative number if
 * photon position is not in the in the grid for the domain of interest.
 *
 * @details
 * This routine carries out a bilinear interpolation of the wind velocity.  The velocities
 * at the edges of the grid cells must have been defined elsewhere (e.g in wind_define).
 *
 * If the position is outside the wind grid, then the velocities will be returned as 0.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 * For all of the 2d coordinate systems, the positions in the WindPtr array are
 * calculated in the xz plane.  As a result, the velocities in that array are
 * calcuated there as well.  Hence, to obtain the velocity in cartesion coordinates
 * one needs to do a simple rotation of the velocity vector.
 *
 * For spherical (1d) coordinates the situation is complex, the philosopy that
 * has been adopted is to let the program run as if the wind model is intrinsically
 * 2d.   The xyz positions of the grid are defined are defined so that
 * are in the xz plane at an angle of 45 degrees to the x axis.  This was done
 * so that if one used, say an sv wind, in spherical coordinates, one would select
 * the wind velocities at a plausible location.   But it implies that the velocities
 * that have been accepted are not purely radial as one might expect.  The choice
 * that has been made is to assume that v[1] is preserved as a non zero value in
 * making the projection.  An alternative might have been to preserve the angular
 * rotation rate.
 *
 * If we ever implement a real 3d coordinate system, one will need to look at
 * this routine again.
