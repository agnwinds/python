 *
 * @brief  These are a series of routines designed to store comments and errors
 * in a diagnostic file or files.  The routines also provide a mechanism for tracking the numbers of errors
 * of each type
 *
 * Instead of using printf and fprintf statements throughout varius subroutines, the set of routines
 * here are intended to provide a standard interface to various diagnostic files, and to manage the interaction of 
 * logging with the various mpi threads that can exist when running Python in multiprocessor mode.  The routines
 * also contain a verbosity mechanism to allow one to control how much information is written to the screen, and a 
 * mechanism to keep track of the number of times a particular error message has been generated.  The overall goal 
 * is to keep the log files produced by Python a manageable size.
 *
 * Messages in Python runs are sent to the screen and to diagnostic files.  During multiprocessing runs, a diagnostic 
 * file is opened for each thread.  With some exceptions, messages to the screen arise from thread 0.  
 * 		
 *  The routines that control what files are open and closed for logging are as follows.
 * - Log_init(filename)			Open a logfile
 * - Log_append(filename)			Reopen an existing log file (so that one can continue to log to it)
 * - Log_close()				Close the current logfile
 *
 *   The routines that write to the log files (and optionally the screen) for informational reasons are:
 *  - Log ( char *format, ...)			Send a message to the screen and logfile
 *  - Log_silent ( char *format, ...)		Send a message to the logfile
 *
 * The routines that are designed to report errors are as follows: 
 * - Shout( char *format, ...)	   Send a message to the screen and logfile that cannot be suppressed.
 * - Error ( char *format, ...)			Send a message prefaced by the word "Error:" to the screen and to the logfile.
 * - Error_silent ( char *format, ...)		Send a message prefaced by the word "Error:" to
 * 										the logfile
 *
 *  One can control how much information is printed to the screen and how many times a specific error message is logged 
 *  to a file with several routines
 *  - Log_set_verbosity(vlevel)			Set the verbosity of the what is printed to the screen and the log file
 *  - Log_print_max(print_max)			Set the number of times a single error will be 
 * 	    output to the screen and the log file
 *
 *  The amount printed out is controlled by a command line switch -v (in Python).   The default value causes Shout, Log, 
 *  and Error to be printed and logged, but not Log_silent Error_silent.  The default value is 5. If the value is raised 
 *  more data will be printed or logged.  
 *
 *  In most cases, it is sufficient to log to the screen only from thread 0.  there are a few times, one might want to 
 *  send a message to the screen from any thread. For this purpose there is a specific command:
 *  - Log_parallel(message)			Log statement for parallel reporting
 *
 *
 *  There are several specific commands that have been included for debugging problems:
 *  - Log_flush()					simply flushes the logfile to disk (before the program crashes).
 *  - Debug( char *format, ...) 			Log an statement to the screen and to a file.  This is essentially a 
 *						        intended to replace a printf statement in situations where
 *							one is debugging code.  The use of Debug instead of log
 *							means that a future developer should be free to remove the
 *							Debug statement from the code.  Because the command prepends the word Debug to 
 *							the write staatement, it should be easy to grep debug statements out of the log files
 *
 *
 *  For errors, the logging routines keep track of how many times a particular error has been reported, using the format 
 *  statement as a proxy for the error.  After a certin number of times a particular error has been roported the error is
 *  no longer written out to the diag file, but the routens still keep trank of the nubmer of times the error is reported.
 *  If this number becomes too large then, the progam exits, and when it does it indicates why. There are a nubmer of 
 *  routines associated with this.
 *
 *
 *  - error_summary(char *format)	Summarize all of the erors that have been
 * 					logged to this point in time
 *
 *
 *  In addition there are several routines that largely internal
 *
 *  - Log_set_mpi_rank(rank, n_mpi)		Tells  the rank of the parallel process in parallel mode,
 * 						and divides max errors by n_mpi
 *     
 *
 *
