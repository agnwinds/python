 * @brief      Conduct a diagnostic test for some purpose
 *
 *
 * @details
 *  This is a totally uncommented routine for use 
 *  with Python to perform some specific diagnostic 
 *  test
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * xtest is called based on a commmand line switch
 * -xtest.  Depending on whether an exit command is
 * included here (the normal situation), the code
 * will continue to run after that.
 *
 * The routine is called after all of the inputs
 * of a run have been read in.  In many cases
 * (namely when the -r (restart option is used,
 * a previous wind file.
 *
 * xtest is intended to be temporary.  Developers should
 * not expect to be the same the next time they want to
 * debug something.  As a result, developers may want
 * to save their version of xtest.c outside of the
 * git repository for later use.
 *
 * Ideally, developers would indicate what issue one trying
 * to solve and recored the commit assoicated with this 
 * along with the issue, in case one wants to locate
 * what was done
 *
 * This version is assocated with issue 900
