/** 
 * @brief      calculates the correction term used in in the L+M and 
 * Sim equations as a modfication to the Saha equation
 *
 * @param [in] double  temp   The temperature for the calculation
 * @param [in] int  nion  the ion we are recombining to
 * @param [in] int  mode  The mode  allow that controls how zeta is calcuated
 * @return     zeta, the correction factor to the recombination rates.
 *
 * @details
 *
 * zeta is part of correction factor suggested in LM93 in a modified version
 * of the on-the spot approximation.  Specifically it is the
 * fraction of recombinations that go directly to the ground state
 * Saha equation.  
 *
 * * mode 1 is the original version, it takes ilow, ihi and interpfrac and 
 *  interpolates in the ground state fraction table.
 * * mode 2 attempts to modify zeta by application of the dielectronic recombination
 *  rate - this calculates zeta from first principles using ground state recombination
 * 	rates and total recombination rates. It defaults to mode 1 if is it missing data
 * 	but it returns an error.
 *
 * 	The program will exit if the mode is unknown.
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * Values for zeta were tabulated by CK (circa 2000)
 *
 * When compute_zeta is called, nion is the lower ion in the pair whose abundances are being calculated.
 * Calls to the various recombination rate coefficient subroutines are made with nion+1, since these
 * rates are tabulated for the recombining ion.
 *
 * The data are read in by get_atomicdata.c (around line 2100)
