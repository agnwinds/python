 Synopsis:

	int spectrum_init(f1,f2,nangle,angle,phase,scat_select,top_bot_select,select_extract) 
	allocates space for and initializes the spectrum arrays

Arguments:		
	double f1,f2;			the minimimum and maximum frequency in the spectrum
	int nangle;			the number of different angles and phases for which 
					spectra must be created
	double angle[],phase[];		the corresponding inclination angles and orbital phases
	int scat_select[]		a code which allows limit the photons which will be summed
					to specific numbers of scatters
					>999 -> select everything
					0 < scat_select < MAXSCAT -> select only those photons 
					which have scattered nscat times, 
					scat_select<0 -> select those phtons with more than |nscat| 
					scatters
					This parallels the angle array
	int top_bot_select		a code which allows one to limit whether all photons or just those
					photons above or below the disk are selected
						0 -> all
						>0 -> only those above the disk
						<0-> only those below the disk 
 	int select_extract		0 for Live or Die option, extract option otherwise
 	
Returns:
 
Description:	
	The first time spectrum_init  is called (i.e. if ispec_start=0), it allocates memory 
	for the various spectrum arrays.  (This is done one time, so one needs to allocate 
	space for all the arrays even though they are not all used in the ionization step).  
	The total number of spectra created is nangle+MSPEC.
	
	Each time spectrum_init is called it rezeros all the spectrum information and 
	calculates the other information associated with each spectrum, such as the
	angle cosines and the names of each spectrum.
		
Notes:
	angle[],phase[] and scat_select[] only apply to the spectra extracted at 
	specific angles.  angle[0], phase[0], and scat_select[0] all affect spec[3]

?? I have a suspicion that these wavelengths are off by half a bin in one direction or the other ???

	Warning - Do not put anything in this routine that does anything but initialize
	or reinitialize the spectrum structure s. This is important because this routine
	is not accessed if one is continuing an old calculation of the detailed spectrum.
	It is still use on a restart where the detailed spectral cycles have not begun
	because in that case the spectra are not saved.

History:
 	97jan   ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort. 
 	97jul	ksl	Updated to allow extraction of photons at specific phases
 	97aug	ksl	Updated to allow spectra to be created which sum only a
 			specific number of scatters.  (Basically this just involved
 			populating s[].nscat.  Currently it has no effect on live or
 			die option. 
 	97sep21	ksl	Provided for renormalization of spectrum through s[n].renorm.
 			This should only affect which affect Live or die option.  
	99dec29	ksl	Began modifications intended to allow the creation of additional
			spectra from the varioous sources of photons, the star, the disk
			and the wind.  Replaced the old fixed number 3 with MSPEC.  Also
			elimininated some checks which should no longer be needed.

 Synopsis:

 int spectrum_create(p,f1,f2,nangle,select_extract) increments the spectrum arrays
 	after each flight of photons is processed.
  
Arguments:		
	PhotPtr p;
	double f1,f2;			the minimimum and maximum frequency in the spectrum
	int nangle;				the number of different angles and phases for which 
							spectra must be created
	int select_extract;		The integer stating whether the Live or Die option has 
						been chosen. (0==Live or Die)
Returns:
  
Description:	

	This routine increments the total spectrum arrays based on what has happened to each 
	photon.  In the Live or Die option, the spectra at specific angles are also created here.
 
	The routine is called after each batch of photons has been transported through the wind and 
	prints some intermediate results to assure the user that the program is still running.  

Notes:

	Summing up of the spectra in the "extract" option is done in extract.c
	
	!! To create spectra in the live or die option which are selected 
	on the number of scatters individual photons undergo, there are 
	some additional changes required to this routine.  These changes 
	should parallel those now in extract under the normal option.  97aug29
	
History:
 	97jan	ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort.
 	97nov23 ksl	Modified to use new error and logging routines  
	02jan	ksl	Added live or die capability to extract specific 
			scatters and above and below plane
	02jul	ksl	Reduced printing of error messages when frequency
			seemed out of bounds since due to Doppler shifts
			at the time of photon creation, the frequencies
			can exceed the range of the formal limits somewhat.
	05apr	ksl	Removed code which summed up the points where
			the last scattering occurred, as not sufficiently
			important to retain given the desire to deal with
			both 1-d and 2-d grids simulataneouly.  
	08mar	ksl	Fixed up spectrum types to account for tracking
			of photons which had been scattered by the wind
	1212	ksl	Changed the way dealt with photons which had
			frequencies which were too low or too high
			to record the numbers and to give an error
			only if the numbers seemed large

Arguments:		

	char filename[]		The name of the file to write
	char mode[];		The mode in which the file should be opened, usually 'w', but
					it could be 'a'
	int nspecmin,nspecmax	These two numbers define the spectra you want to write.    
	int select_spectype	The type of spectral file you want to create, 
					0 = raw, 1= flambda,2=fnu 
        double	renorm		This is renormalization which incrementally decreases to
				one as the detailed spectral calculation goes forward.  It
				was added to allow one to print out the spectrum at the
				end of each cycle, rather than the end of the entire
				calculation.
	char loglin[]		Are we outputting a log or a linear spectrum
				

Returns:
  
Description:	
	This simple routine simply writes the spectra to a file in an easily interpretable
	ascii format. Normally one would write all of the spectra in one go, but  one can use 
	spectrum summary to write various spectra to various files by using the variables
	nspecmin and nspecmax.. 
	
	Normally s[0],s[1],and s[2] will be the escaping, scattered, and absorbed spectrum.  
	The rest will be those which have been "extracted".   
	
	It can be called multiple times. In Python, it is currently called twice, once at the
	end of the ionization stage and once when computation of the detailed spectra are
	completed.
			
Notes:

History:
 	97jan      ksl	Coded and debugged as part of Python effort.
 	97sep13	ksl	Removed some extra code which had to do with opening the files.
 	97sep21	ksl	Modified normalization of spectrum s[n].renorm which affects 
 				Live or die option.  
	02apr	ksl	Added renorm option so that the spectrum will have the
			same overall "flux" when each incremental spectrum is printed
			out.
	10nov   nsh	Added another switch if we are outputting a log or a lin spectrum
