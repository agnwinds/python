  Synopsis:   

int
variable_temperature (xplasama, mode)  modifies the densities of ions, levels, and
	partition functions of ions within a cell of the wind based upon the mode, 
	and other data contained within the WindPtr itself, such as t_r, t_e, w, 
	based on the "mode".  

        Unlike nebular_concentrations, this code works on pairs of ions at a time, 
	and uses a temperature calculated to be suitable for that particular pair
	to have a ratio of abundances about equal to 1.
  
  Arguments:		
     PlasmaPtr ww;
     int mode;			// 6=correct using a dilute blackbody
     				   7=correct using a broken power law spectrum


  Returns:
 	variable temperature alters portions of the wind ptr.  Exactly how things 
	are changed depends on the mode.
 
 	variable_temperature returns 0 if it converged to an answer, -1 otherwise.  On an
 	abnormal return the density array and ne are left unchanged.
 	
  Description:	


 
  Notes:



  History:
	2012Feb	nsh	Coded and debugged as part of QSO effort. 
        1212Dec nsh	Recoded so that the densities are computed in a temporary array, and only 
			committted to the real density structure once we are sure the code converges.
	2013Sep nsh	ground state fudge computed at the start, and stored in an array rather
			than contiunually recomputing it - sometimes it is expensive.

  Synopsis:   
	pl_correct_2(xtemp,nion) calculates the 
 	correction factor of the number density of two adjacent levels calculated
	at any temperature based upon a true radiation field modelled by a broken power law
 
  Arguments:		

	double xtemp		the temperature at which the saha abundances were calculated
	int nion;		the upper ion in an ion pair for which we want to correction factyor

  Returns:
 	q		        the correction factor
 	
 Description:	

	 

 
  Notes:
	The weights and alpha values needed for the integrals are communicated to this routine vias xxxplasma, an external varaible which is popullated in the variable_temperature routine.
	The integrals over power law require individual alphas and w, these are communicated via external variables xpl_alpha and xpl_w.	


  History:
 
	12feb	NSH	Coded as part of the quasar project
        12aug   NSH     Added code to allow an exponential model of j to be used.
	13sep	NSH	Reversed commenting out of lines that check for maximum frequency and 
			reset integration limits - unsure why this was ever commented out!
	13sep	NSH	Changed to always use the topbase style of data - verner data is now tabulated.
