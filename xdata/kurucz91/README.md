# Kurucz Models

This directory contains the Kurucz Stellar models in an ascii format suitable for use
in Python.  They are included here mainly as an example, and in order to allow for
regression testing.  In particular, the models are fairly coarse in terms of their
wavelength resolution.  

Larger grids of models are available as a separate repository on the AGNWinds 
github site.  


The units are converted to be identical those calculated with Tlusty/Synspec, 
e.g ergs/cm**2/s/A, and the normalization should be identical.
