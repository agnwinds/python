Synopsis:
	These are all of the routines necessary to define a YSO wind, which comprises
	a KWD wind in some places and a stellar wind elsewhere.  The model is for
	a stellar wind within the inner windcone.
Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	

Notes:


History:
 	04jun	ksl	Added this possibility, beginning with the same code for a kwd wind
			Where possible, I have simply chosen to get the data needed
			from the original kwd or stellar wind routines.

Synopsis:
	get_yso_wind_params gets input data that are necessary for a YSO
	comprising a region that resembles a KWD wind and a region outside
	this that contins a speherical wind
Arguments:		

Returns:
 
Description:	
	Basically this routine just reads the inputs from the two separate
	wind models, since this is a combination of the two.
Notes:
	The model has a spherical wind on the interior.  The windcones
	are set to include the region from the polar axis to the outside
	edge of the wind.  (Note that when filling out the grid regions
	outside the wind may have non-zero values of quantities, such
	as density.  This allows for interpolation to occur. But there
	will not be (should not be) any scattering or whatever in this
	region since that wind cones define the regions where photons
	are scattered.  


History:

        04Sep   SS      Changed finite disk case to cut off wind
