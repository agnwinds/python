  Synopsis:

The routines in this file are to do with computing the correction to the saha equation.



  Description:

Zeta is the term in lucy and mazzali which corrects for the proportion of recombinations
going directly to the ground state. 

nsh: I'm experimenting with moving it out of saha and stuart_sim
since the same factor will be used in both, and I'm going to add in some more options to
incorporate a correction factor for dielectronic recombination.

  Synopsis: compute_zeta calculates the correction term in the L+M and sim equations
        for corrected saha.
                                                                                                   
  Description:
	mode 1 is the original version, it takes ilow, ihi and interpfrac and 
        interpolates in the ground state fraction table.
        mode 2 attempts to modify zeta by application of the dielectronic recombination
 	rate
                                                                                                   
  Arguments:  
	temperature - the temperature of the cell
	nion - the ion we are recombining from
  	ilow,ihi - the bracketing elements in the interpfrac table (can be the same in at extremes)
        interpfrac - the distnce between the two bracketing temps
	f1,f2 - the frequency band over which we are interested - NB this doesnt really do that much, 
	since integ_fb ends up resetting the limits.
	mode - this will allow control here, so we can have the 
		1: interpfrac type, 
		2: interpfrac but then incorporating DR as an additional correction.
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
  Returns:
	zeta, the correction factor to the recombination rates. 
                                                                                                   
  Notes: When compute_zeta is called, nion is the lower ion in the pair whose abundances are being calculated.

                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
 History:	
		Aug 2011 NSH - coding started to try to incorportate DR into python
		Feb 2012 NSH - modified to include code to find the interpfrac parameter here
				this is to improve the new code for using multiple temperature
				saha equaions - each equaion needs its own correction factor, 
				so it makes better code to call it.
		Jul 2012 NSH - modified to include use of Badnell recombination coefficients
				to allow dielectronic recombination to be included in the 
				zeta term
